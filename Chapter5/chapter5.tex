\newpage

This chapter will depend on the progress in the shrinkage simulations.
If everything goes with shrinkage, then maybe i can put it in Thercast and test the solid deformation also and apply to TEXUS
If not then this chapter will only cover these topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the CCEMLCC experimental facilities (ground experiments, sound rocket, ISS)
\item Focus on TEXUS (setup, conditions, previous results, recent failures...)
\item 

\end{itemize}
