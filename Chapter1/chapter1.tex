\section{Introduction}
Divide into 2 families of models: with and without level set. Regarding the second family of models,
the level set method has been applied on several occasions, but in a different way. Some references
apply it to track the solid-liquid interface, a situation more commonly known as the "Stefan problem".
The scope such applications mainly encompasses dendritic modelling and simulation \\

Other references, in relevance to our scope, apply this method to track the surface of the metal
while going from the liquid state to the solid state, in contact with the surrounding gas which is usually air.

\section{Modelling macrosegreation}
%-------------
\subsection{Dendritic growth}
In a casting process, the chill surface i.e. the contact between the molten alloy and relatively cold moulds, is the first area to solidify. 
Thermal gradient, $G$, and cooling rate $R$ are two crucial process parameters that define the interface speed $\vstar$, which in turn,
affects the initial microstructure. Although it may be not easy to control them, it remains important to understand their implication in solidification.

The solid-liquid interface fluctuates when solidifying, thus perturbations may appear on the front, locally destabilizing it. 
Two outcome scenarios are possible.
The first scenario is characterized by low values of $\vstar$ where the interface maintains a planar shape, hence we speak of \emph{planar growth}. 
With this kind of growth, a random protuberance appearing at the interface, has a low tip velocity (low driving force of solidification). As such,
the rest of the interface catches up, keeping the planar geometry.
In another scenario, where a real casting is considered, the interface speed is greater in general, due to high solidification rate.
The protuberance tip will be pulled into a liquid less rich in solute than the interface. The zone ahead of the solid-liquid interface is constitutionally undercooled \citep{tiller_redistribution_1953}, giving a greater driving force for the protuberance to grow in the direction
of the thermal gradient. As it has a tree-like shape, we speak of \emph{dendritic growth}. Near the chill surface, dendrites are columnar, with a 
favourable growth in the <100> direction for alloys with cubic lattices, but different orientations are also reported in the literature \citep[see][289]{dantzig_solidification_2009}.
If temperature is uniform, which the case usually far from mould walls, a similar dendritic growth phenomenon occurs, but with an equiaxed morphology.

Columnar dendrites are characterized by a primary spacing, $\pdas$, between the main trunks, and a secondary spacing, $\sdas$, for the arms that are perpendicular
to the trunks. It should be noted that $\sdas$, together with the grain size, are two important microstructural parameters in the as-cast microstructure \citep{easton_grain_2011}.
Further branching may occur but will not be discussed here.

\subsection{Mush permeability}
The dendritic geometry is crucial in solidification theory as it exhibits lower solid fraction compared to a microstructure formed by planar growth.
This fact has consequences in the fluid-structure interaction in the mushy zone, namely the liquid flow through dendrites. At the chill surface,
the solid  grows gradually from dispersed growing nuclei, to a permeable solid skeleton until finally grains have fully grown with the end of phase change.
The intermediate state where liquid can flow in and out of the mushy zone through the dendrites is a key phenomenon from a rheological perspective.
%By defining a \emph{coherency temperature} $\Tcoh$, one can distinguish two behaviors. 
%For temperatures below $\Tcoh$ (usually at low solid fractions), the liquid flow is characterized by an intrinsic velocity. 
%As for temperature above $\Tcoh$,
%For the rest of this section, we will focus on the first behavior where liquid has a relative freedom to move inside the mushy zone.
The flow through the solid skeleton is damped by primary and secondary dendrites, resulting in momentum dissipation just like in saturated porous media. 
The famous \citet{darcy_les_1856} law relates the pressure gradient ($\nabvec p$) to the fluid velocity $\vec{v}$, through the following equation \citep{rappaz_numerical_2003}:
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:darcy}
& \vec{v} = \frac{\K}{\mu} \nabvec p
\end{align}
%----------------------
where $\mu$ is the liquid dynamic viscosity and $\K$ is the permeability tensor. The latter parameter has been the subject of numerous studies that aimed
to predict it from various microstructural or morphological parameters.
Some of these studies has started even before the first attempts to model macrosegregation by \citet{flemings_macrosegregation:_1967, flemings_macrosegregation:_1968-1,flemings_macrosegregation:_1968}. Basically, all models include the solid fraction, $\gs$, as input 
to predict mush permeability along with empirical data. An instance of such models is the work of \citet{xu_gravity-_1991}.
Some models rely additionally on the primary dendrite arm spacing $\pdas$ like Blake-Kozeny \citep{ramirez_evaluation_2003}, or the secondary 
dendrite arm spacing $\sdas$ like Carman-Kozeny, as a meaningful parameter to determine an isotropic permeability. 
Other models like \citet{poirier_permeability_1987,felicelli_simulation_1991} derive an anisotropic permeability based on both $\pdas$ and $\sdas$.

The present work uses Carman-Kozeny as a constitutive model for the permeability scalar (zero order tensor):
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:permeability}
& \K  = \frac{\sdas^2 \gl^3}{180\brac{1-\gl}^2}
\end{align}
%----------------------
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Microsegregation}
Microsegregation is a fundamental phenomenon in solidification. The simplest definition would be 
an uneven distribution of solute between liquid and the herein growing solid, at the microscopic scale
of the interface separating these phases. If we consider a binary alloy, then the solubility limit is 
the key factor that dictates the composition at which a primary solid phase exists in equilibrium. 
The segregation (or partition) coefficient $\k$ determines the extent of solute rejection into the liquid during solidification:
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:partition}
& \k = \frac{\Csstar}{\Clstar}
\end{align}
%----------------------
where $\Csstar$ and $\Clstar$ are the compositions of the solid and liquid respectively, at the interface. When the 
segregation coefficient is less than unity (such is the case for most alloys during dendritic solidification), 
the first solid forms with a composition $\k \Clstar=\k \Cnominal$ less than the liquid's 
composition $\Cnominal$, the latter being initially at the nominal composition, $\Cnominal$. \Cref{fig:binary_diag} illustrates a typical binary 
phase diagram where the real solidus and liquidus are represented by solid lines, while the corresponding linear approximations are in dashed lines.
For most binary alloys, this linearisation simplifies derivation of microsegregation models, as $\k$ becomes independent of temperature.

For each phase, the relationship between the composition at the interface and that in the bulk depends on the chemical homogenisation ability of the phase.
The more homogeneous a phase, the closer the concentrations between the interface and the bulk, hence closer to equilibrium.
%The higher the diffusion coefficient of the phase, $\Dphi$, the closer the concentrations between the interface and the bulk. 
It is thus essential to study the effect of homogenisation on the segregation behaviour and the subsequent effect on solidification, which leads the formalism of microsegregation models.

\subsubsection{Microsegregation models}
Solid formation depends greatly on the ability of chemicals species to diffuse within each of the solid and liquid phases, but also across the
solid-liquid interface. Furthermore, chemical diffusion like all other diffusional process, is a time-dependent phenomenon. One can thus conclude that two factors
influence the amount of solid formation: cooling rate and diffusion coefficients. However, convection and other mechanical mixing sources, 
homogenise the composition much faster than atomic diffusion. As such, \emph{complete mixing} in the liquid is always an acceptable assumption, regardless of the 
solidification time. We may speak of infinite diffusion in the liquid. Nevertheless, diffusion in the solid also known as \emph{back diffusion}, is the only transport mechanism with very low diffusion coefficients. Therefore, chemical species require a long time, i.e. low cooling rate, to completely diffuse within the solid.
The difference in diffusional behaviour is summarized by two limiting segregation models of perfect equilibrium and nonequilibrium at the scale
of a secondary dendrite arm, which are the lever rule and Gulliver-Scheil models, respectively. Afterwards, models with finite back diffusion are presented. 
%------------
\subsubsection*{Lever rule}
The lever rule considers an ideal equilibrium in all phases, i.e. solidification is extremely slow, hence phase compositions are 
homogeneous ($ \Clstar = \Cl$ and $ \Csstar = \Cs$ ) at all times as a consequence of complete mixing. 
These compositions are given by:
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:leverrule}
& \Cl= \Clstar = \k \Csstar = \k \Cs \\
& \Cs= \Csstar = \frac{\Cnominal}{\k(1-\fs) + \fs}
\end{align}
%----------------------
At the end of solidification, the composition of the solid phase is equal to the nominal composition, $\Cs = \Cnominal$
%------------
\subsubsection*{Gulliver-Scheil}
The other limiting case is the absence of diffusion in the solid. That includes also the diffusion at the interface, so nothing diffuses in or out. The consequence is a steady increase of the homogeneous liquid composition while the solid composition remains non-uniform.
Compared to a full equilibrium approach, higher fractions of liquid
will remain until eutectic composition is reached, triggering a eutectic solidification. The phase compositions are given by:
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:scheil}
& \Cl= \Clstar = \k \Csstar \\
& \Cs= \k \Cnominal (1-\fs)^{1-\k}
\end{align}
%------------
\subsubsection*{Finite back diffusion}
It has been concluded that the assumption of a negligeable back diffusion overestimates the liquid composition
and the resulting eutectic fraction. Therefore, many models studied the limited diffusion in the solid. One of the earliest models is the Brody-Flemings models \citep{khan_influence_2014} that is a based on a differential solute balance equation for a parabolic growth rate, as follows:
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:brodyflemings}
& \Cl= \Clstar = \k \Csstar \\
& \Cs= \k \Cnominal \crochet{ 1 - \brac{ 1 - 2 \Fos \k } \fs }^{\frac{\k-1}{1 - 2 \Fos \k }}
\end{align}
%------------
where $\Fos$ is the dimensionless \emph{Fourier number} for diffusion in the solid \citep{dantzig_solidification_2009}. It depends on the 
solid diffusion coefficient $\Ds$, solidification time $\tsolidif$ and the secondary dendrite arm spacing, as follows: 
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:fouriersolid}
& \Fos = \frac{\Ds \tsolidif}{\brac{\sdas / 2}^2}
\end{align}
%------------
Several other models were since suggested and used. The interested reader is referred to the following non exhaustive list of publications: \citet{clyne_solute_1981,kobayashi_solute_1988,ni_volume-averaged_1991,wang_multiphase_1993,combeau_modeling_1996,martorano_solutal_2003,tourret_generalized_2009}.
%------------------------------------
\subsection{Macroscopic solidification model: monodomain}
In this section, we will present the macroscopic conservations equations that enable us to predict 
macrosegregation in the metal when the latter is the only domain in the system.
%-------------
\subsubsection{Volume averaging}
It is crucial for a solidification model to represent phenomena on the microscale, then scale up to predict 
macrscopic phenomena. Nevertheless, the characteristic length of a small scale in solidification may represent a dendrite arm spacing, for instance the mushy zone permeability, as it may also represent an atomic distance if one is interested, for instance, in the growth competition between diffusion and surface energy of the solid-liquid interface. Modelling infinitely small-scale phenomena could be prohibitively expensive in computation time, if the we target industrial scales. 

The volume averaging is a technique that allows bypassing this barrier by averaging
small-scale variations on a so-called \emph{representative volume element} (RVE) \citep{dantzig_solidification_2009} with the 
following dimensional constraints on its volume, \rev:
the element should be large enough to "see" and average microscopic fluctuations whilst being smaller than the scale of macroscopic variations.
Solid and liquid may exist simultaneously in the RVE, but no gas phase is considered (volume saturation: $\Vs+\Vl=\rev$). 
Moreover, temperature is assumed uniform and equal for all the phases.
The formalism, introduced by \citet{ni_volume-averaged_1991}, is summarized by the following equations for any physical quantity $\psi$:
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:volumeaveraging1}
& \avg{\psi} = \frac{1}{\rev} \integral{\rev}{\psi}{\Omega} = \avg{\psi^s} + \avg{\psi^l}
\end{align}
%------------
where $\psis$ and $\psil$ are phase averages of $\psi$. Then, for any phase $\phi$, one can introduce the \emph{phase intrinsic average} of $\psi$, denoted $\avg{\psi}^\phi$, by writing:
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:volumeaveraging2}
& \avg{\psi^\phi} = \frac{1}{\rev} \integral{\Vphi}{\psi}{\Omega} = \gphi \avg{\psi}^\phi
\end{align}
%------------
where $\gphi$ is the volume fraction of the phase. To finalize, the averaging is applied to temporal and spatial derivation operators \citep{rivaux_simulation_2011}:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:volumeaveraging3}
& \avg{ \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} ^\phi } = \frac{\partial \avg{\psi^\phi}}{\partial t} - \integral{\gammastar}{\psi^\phi \vstar \cdot \vec{n^\phi}}{\Gamma} \\
& \avg{ \nabvec \psi^\phi } = \nabvec \avg{\psi^\phi} + \integral{\gammastar}{\psi^\phi \vec{n^\phi}}{\Gamma}
\end{align}
%------------
where $\vstar$ is the local relative interface velocity and $\gammastar$ is the solid-liquid interface, while $n^\phi$ is the normal to $\gammastar$, directed outwards.
The previous equations will be used to derive a set macroscopic conservation equations. It is noted that the intrinsic average $\avg{\psi}^\phi$ may
be replaced by ${\psi}^\phi$ for notation simplicity, whenever the averaging technique applies.
