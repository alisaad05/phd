\chapter{Modelling Review}
\minitoc
\newpage

In this chapter the following points are discussed
\begin{itemize}
\item what does a typical solidifications problem consist of ? heat - fluid - solid 
- chemical species
\item what are the modeling scales of these physics ? direct (micro: phase field / macro: CA) 
and indirect (micro Nancy models / macro: current FE model)
\comment{Maybe worth showing the 2x2 table that CAG showed at the ICASP conference ?}
\item Overview of these models ??
\item Presence of AIR requires a new problem definition : Lagrangian or Eulerian framework
\end{itemize}


\section{FE model}
A section presenting the main FE equations that will be solved in the metal being a single domain.
\begin{itemize}
\item Energy (chapter 1)
\item
\end{itemize}

\comment{talking about Eulerian approach Air Metal will be presented in the next chapters}

\section{Biblio test}
\cite{carozzani_direct_2013} are going to appear in the paper
