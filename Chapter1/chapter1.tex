Casting is one of the earliest production techniques created by human civilisation since the Bronze Age, dated to circa 5000 years ago. 
From ancient swords to nowadays Swiss Army Knives, the need for alloys has never decreased.
The key phenomenon behind this technique is solidification, or the transformation of matter from liquid to solid state. With this phase change, 
many phenomena which are not visible to the naked eye, take place with a very complex interaction, in order to form a solid. 
However, the combination of heat transfer (e.g. release of latent heat) and mass transfer (e.g. redistribution of chemical
elements and phases), often lead to defects. \emph{Segregation} is a type of defect which can lead to uncontrolled properties of cast parts. 
The Latin origin of this word, \emph{segregatus}, has the social meaning of "separating a group from the dominant majority", while 
in metallurgy it means a non uniform distribution of chemical species. Depending on the scale, we may speak of \emph{microsegregation}
when the heterogeneity spans some few hundred microns, whereas the term \emph{macrosegregation} refers to a much coarser length scale, ranging
from some millimetres to some meters! The solidified structure has intrinsic thermophysical and thermomechanical properties directly influenced by the segregation pattern. 

In casting processes, such as continuous casting (\cref{fig:continuous_casting}) and ingot casting (\cref{fig:ingot_casting}), it is crucial to apprehend 
the intricate phenomena leading to macrosegregation. Its influence on intermediate processing steps (e.g. forging, coating, welding,...)
to reach a manufactured product, also needs to be understood.
In this introductory chapter, we give a quick overview of solidification phenomena and microstructure, then present the factors which
promote segregation, on both microscopic and macroscopic scales. Aside from macrosegregation, other defects are also briefly presented.

In a continuous casting process (\cref{fig:continuous_casting}), the partially solidified slab is carried through a series of rolls that exert contact forces to straighten it.
When a slab enters through these rolls after exiting the open copper mould, it consists of a thin solid shell that contains a mixture of solid and liquid phases known as the mushy zone, 
with a core still fully liquid.
Enriched liquid accumulates halfway in thickness, forming a centreline macrosegregation
as shown in \cref{fig:macroseg_centreline}.  

Other types of segregation patterns can be encountered while casting heavy ingots, as schematised in \cref{fig:macrosegregation_ingot}: 
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item a negative segregation cone promoted by the sedimentation of 
	  equiaxed crystals and settling of dendrite fragments, often seen at the bottom part of the ingot,
\item positive segregation channels, known as A-segregates, form along the columnar dendritic zones, close to the vertical contact with the mould,
\item positive V-segregates can be identified in the centre of the ingot,
\item a positive "hot-top" macrosegregation in the upper zone where the last rich liquid solidifies, caused by thermosolutal buoyancy forces. 
\end{itemize}
\citet{combeau_prediction_2009} state that A-segregates and V-segregates formation is mainly attributed to local flow phenomena.
As such, their scale is finer than macrosegregation, hence called "mesosegregates".

\section{Solidification notions}
%***********************************************
%
%***********************************************
\subsection{Solute partitioning}
%***********************************************
The simplest definition of this phenomenon is an uneven distribution of solute between the liquid and the growing solid, at the microscopic scale
of the interface separating these phases. If we consider a binary alloy, then the solubility limit is 
the key factor that dictates the composition at which a primary solid phase exists at equilibrium. 
The segregation (or partition) coefficient $\k$ determines the extent of solute rejection into the liquid during solidification:

%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:partition}
& \k = \frac{\Csstar}{\Clstar}
\end{align}
%----------------------

where $\Csstar$ and $\Clstar$ are the solute compositions at the interface, of the solid and liquid phases respectively. When the 
segregation coefficient is less than unity (such is the case for most alloys during dendritic solidification), 
the first solid forms at the liquidus temperature, $T_L$, with a composition $\Csstar=\k \Clstar$ less than the surrounding liquid 
composition, the latter being initially at the nominal composition, $\Cnominal$. \Cref{fig:binary_diag} illustrates a typical binary 
phase diagram where the real solidus and liquidus are represented by solid lines, while the possible linear approximations are in grey dashed lines.
For most binary alloys, this linearisation simplifies derivation of microsegregation models, as $\k$ becomes independent of temperature.

For each phase, the relationship between the composition at the interface and that in the bulk depends on the chemical homogenisation of the phase by solute transport.
The more homogeneous a phase, the closer the concentrations between the interface and the bulk, hence closer to equilibrium.
%The higher the diffusion coefficient of the phase, $\Dphi$, the closer the concentrations between the interface and the bulk. 
It is thus essential to study the effect of homogenisation on the segregation behaviour and the subsequent effect on solidification, 
which is seen by a non-uniform composition through the cast product on a microscopic scale, better known as microsegregation.
This phenomenon is essential in a casting process inasmuch as it affects the microstructure and grain morphology, hence the final
mechanical properties of the alloy.

%***********************************************
\subsection{Dendritic growth}
%***********************************************
In a casting process, the vicinity of the chill surface where the contact between the molten alloy and the cold moulds, is the first area to solidify. 
Thermal gradient, $\vec{G}$, and cooling rate, $R$, are two crucial parameters that define the solid-liquid interface velocity, $\vstar$, which in turn
affects the initial microstructure. Although it may not be easy to control them, their role in solidification is well established.

% The solid-liquid interface fluctuates when solidifying, thus perturbations may appear on the front, locally destabilizing it. 
% Two outcome scenarios are possible.

and subsequent dendritic solidification \citep{buffet_measurement_2010}.

while the one near the dendritic structure with the yellow and red colours, is richer in solute.}
% label
\label{fig:dendrite_evolution}
\end{figureth}
%-----------------------------------
%

At low values of $\vstar$ where the interface maintains a planar shape, hence we speak of \emph{planar growth}. 
With this kind of growth, a random protuberance appearing at the interface, has a low tip velocity (low driving force of solidification). As such,
the rest of the interface catches up, maintaining the planar geometry.
In another scenario more representative of a real casting, the interface velocity leads to its instability.
The protuberance tip will grow into a liquid less rich in solute, as shown in the experimental frames of \cref{fig:dendrite_evolution}.
The zone ahead of the solid-liquid interface is constitutionally undercooled, giving a greater driving force for the protuberance to grow in the direction
of the thermal gradient. 

An expression for the critical velocity is given by \citet{tiller_redistribution_1953}.
As the solid-liquid interface adopts a tree-like shape, we speak of \emph{dendritic growth}. Near the chill surface, dendrites are columnar, with a 
favourable growth in the $\avg{100}$ direction for alloys with cubic lattices, but different orientations are also reported in the literature \citep[see][289]{dantzig_solidification_2009}.

Far from mould walls, a similar dendritic growth phenomenon occurs where temperature is uniform, but with an equiaxed morphology.
\Cref{fig:dendritic_growth} shows both columnar and equiaxed morphologies. Columnar dendrites are characterised by a primary spacing, 
$\pdas$, between the main trunks, and a secondary spacing, $\sdas$, for the arms that are perpendicular
to the trunks. It should be noted that $\pdas$ and $\sdas$, together with the grain size, are three important 
microstructural parameters in the as-cast microstructure \citep{easton_grain_2011}.
Further branching may occur but will not be presented henceforth.

%***********************************************
\subsection{Mush permeability}
%***********************************************

The dendritic geometry is crucial in solidification theory as it exhibits lower solid 
fraction compared to a microstructure formed by planar growth.
This fact has consequences on the fluid-structure interaction in the mushy zone, namely 
the liquid flow through dendrites. At the chill surface,
the solid  grows gradually from dispersed growing nuclei to a permeable solid skeleton, 
until grains have fully grown at the end of phase change.
In the intermediate state, the liquid flow in and out of the mushy zone through the network 
of dendrites is a key phenomenon from various perspectives, 
especially the rheological perspective .

%By defining a \emph{coherency temperature} $\Tcoh$, one can distinguish two behaviors. 
%For temperatures below $\Tcoh$ (usually at low solid fractions), the liquid flow is characterized by an intrinsic velocity. 
%As for temperature above $\Tcoh$,
%For the rest of this section, we will focus on the first behavior where liquid has a relative freedom to move inside the mushy zone.

The flow through the interdendritic liquid is damped by primary trunks and secondary 
dendrite arms, resulting in momentum dissipation just like in saturated porous media. 
The famous \citet{darcy_les_1856} law relates the liquid pressure $(\gl \pl)$ gradient to 
the average liquid velocity $(\gl \vl)$, 
through the following equation:
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:darcy}
& \vec{v} =-\frac{\K}{\mul} \nabvec \pl
\end{align}
%----------------------
where $\mul$ is the liquid dynamic viscosity and $\K$ is the permeability tensor.
\Cref{eq:darcy} do not account for the solid velocity, $\vec{v^s}$, assuming that the solid phase is fixed,
which can occur in columnar solidification or when equiaxed grains are densely packed in later stages of solidification \citep{rappaz_numerical_2003}.
Evaluating permeability has been the subject of numerous studies that aimed
to predict it from microstructural or morphological parameters.
Some of these studies have started even before the first attempts to model macrosegregation by 
\citet{flemings_macrosegregation:_1967, flemings_macrosegregation:_1968-1,flemings_macrosegregation:_1968}. 

Basically, all models include the solid fraction, $\gs$, as input to predict mush permeability along with empirical data. 
An instance of such models is the work of \citet{xu_gravity-_1991}.
Some models rely additionally on the primary dendrite arm spacing $\pdas$ like Blake-Kozeny \citep{ramirez_evaluation_2003}, or the secondary 
dendrite arm spacing $\sdas$ like Carman-Kozeny, as a meaningful parameter to determine an isotropic permeability. 
Other models like \citet{poirier_permeability_1987,felicelli_simulation_1991} derive an anisotropic permeability based on both $\pdas$ and $\sdas$.

The present work uses a a particular form of the Carman-Kozeny equation as a constitutive model for the isotropic permeability scalar (zero order tensor),
depending on the secondary dendrite arm spacing, $\sdas$, as follows:
%----------------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:permeability}
& \K  = \frac{\sdas^2 \gl^3}{180\brac{1-\gl}^2}
\end{align}
%-----------------------------------

%***********************************************

\section{Macrosegregation}
% ---------------------------

Macrosegregation generally stems from a solubility difference between a liquid phase and one or more solid phases, along with
a relative velocity between these phases. While the former is responsible for local solute enrichment or depletion, the latter
will propagate the composition heterogeneity on a scale much larger than just a few dendrites.
% http://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/little-a-little-few-a-few
This is why macrosegregation could be observed on the scale of a casting, up to several meters in length. 
Microsegregation may be healed by heat treatments to speed up the diffusion process and allow homogenisation. However, heterogeneities 
spanning on larger distances cannot be heat treated after solidification. Macrosegregation is thus an irreversible defect.
Failure to prevent it, may lead to a substantial decline in the alloy's mechanical behaviour and its serviceability.
Experimental investigations of macrosegregation in steels were the subject of numerous studies in the past and until now, 
like the work of \citet{suzuki_mechanism_1973,shah_effect_1989,lesoult_macrosegregation_2005}. They were mainly motivated
by industrial research that aimed at reducing defective production caused by macrosegregation.
However, steels were not the only alloys that were investigated for segregation defects. 
Many studies relied on other metallic alloys as a replacement recourse, for their low
melting points and well-known physical and mechanical properties. Examples are aluminium-based alloys 
(aluminium-copper or aluminium-silicon) \citep{lesoult_equi-axed_2001,ferreira_macrosegregation_2004,ferreira_modeling_2009} 
and lead-tin/tin-lead alloys\citep{hebditch_observations_1974,prescott_convective_1994,hachani_experimental_2012}. Investigating macrosegregation 
is also common in organic compounds like the well-known 
sodium chloride \citep{wanqi_formation_1989,sarazin_studies_1992,ludwig_advanced_2012}, which have the advantage of being transparent.

%\subsection{Causes}

Four main factors can (simultaneously) cause fluid flow leading to macrosegregation:
thermosolutal convection in the liquid, solidification shrinkage, solutal and thermal contraction,
movement and sedimentation of equiaxed crystals and finally solid deformation.

\subsection{Liquid thermosolutal convection}
% ------------------------------------------------

During solidification, the liquid density undergoes changes due to temperature gradients.
Generally for steels, an increasing temperature results in a lighter liquid phase and vice-versa.
These variations create a driving force of thermal convection in the melt, during which 
chemical species are redistributed by convective transport. While a uniform composition
could be maintained throughout the liquid bulk where convective transport is dominant, 
solute gradients may appear in zones where thermal convection currents are not sufficient to homogenise the liquid solution. 
Similarly to thermal gradient, a solute gradient may cause liquid density variations.
Nevertheless, the link between the liquid's composition and its density varies from one alloy to another. 
For some alloys, a positive solute gradient creates a positive density gradient, while
for others the opposite is true, due to a lighter solute effect in the melt density. Whether convection is solute or temperature
dominated, convection currents are important in the formation of macrosegregation, especially that the
liquid phase density varies considerably upon cooling the superheated alloy to room temperature.

%--------------
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:rholiq}
%& \rhol = \rholref ( 1 - \betaT (T - \Tref) - \sum_{i} \betawil (\wil - \wilref) )  \\ 
%\label{eq:gradrholiq}
%& \nabvec\rhol = -\rholref (  \betaT \nabvec T + \sum_{i} \betawil \nabvec\wil  )
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
%--------------
%
%In \cref{eq:rholiq}, density is assumed to vary linearly with temperature and phase composition 
%for each chemical species (index $i$). The slopes defining such variations are respectively the 
%thermal expansion coefficient $\betaT$ and the solutal expansion coefficients $\betawil$, given by:
% \citep{kohler_peritectic_2008}
%
%--------------
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:betaT}
%& \betaT =  -\frac{1}{\rholref} \brac{\frac{\partial\rhol}{\partial T}}  \\ 
%\label{eq:betawil}
%& \betawil = -\frac{1}{\rholref} \brac{\frac{\partial \rhol}{\partial \wil}}  
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
%--------------
%
%The linear fit assumes also that the density takes a reference value, $\rholref$, when temperature 
%and liquid composition reach reference values, respectively $\Tref$ and $\wilref$, while the
%coefficients $\betawil$ remain constant. However, in some 
%situations, a suitable thermodynamic database providing accurate density values is far better than a 
%linear fit, especially in the current context of macrosegregation. 
% Such possibility will be discussed later in the manuscript. %(cf. SECTION \red{TODO})\\ %TODO ) 
%In the presence of gravity, the density gradient in \cref{eq:gradrholiq}, causes thermosolutal convection 
%in the liquid bulk and a subsequent macrosegregation.
%
% 

\subsection{Solidification shrinkage}
% ---------------------------------------

Solids generally have a greater density than the liquid phase ($\rho^s > \rho^l$), 
thus occupy less volume, with some exceptions such as silicon, for which the opposite is true. 
Upon solidification, the liquid therefore moves towards the solidification front to compensate for the volume 
difference caused by the phase change, as well as the phases contraction mainly due to temperature gradient. When macrosegregation is 
triggered by solidification shrinkage, we speak of \emph{inverse segregation}: while one would expect 
negative macrosegregation near the contact with the chill due to diffusion, shrinkage-induced flow 
promotes the opposite phenomenon, by bringing solute-richer liquid towards the solidifying areas, thus raising 
their solute content, and resulting in a positively segregated region.
In contrast to liquid thermosolutal convection, shrinkage flow may cause macrosegregation even without gravity.
%
%

\subsection{Movement of grains}
% ---------------------------------------

%read pickering2013: http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2013/macro.pdf
Globular and equiaxed dendritic grains nucleate and grow in the liquid bulk where thermal gradients 
are weak, or in the presence of inoculants. They are transported by the flow and can float 
or sediment, depending on their density \citep{beckermann_modelling_2002}. During their movement, the nearby 
liquid is driven away before the grains finally settle in the end of solidification. When the solute-rich liquid
is expelled, a negative macrosegregation zone (often referred to as \emph{negative segregation cone} in cast ingots) 
is detected where the grains have finally settled.
%
%

\subsection{Solid deformation} 
% ------------------------------

Stresses of thermal and mechanical nature are always found in casting processes 
(e.g. bulging between rolls in continuous casting). 
Deformation of the semi-solid region located in the mushy zone causes a relative solid-liquid 
flow in the inward (tensile stresses) or outward (compressive stresses) direction, leading to macrosegregation.
%

\section{Other defects}
% ------------------------

Apart from macrosegregation, other defects are also encountered in industrial processes. 
In the casting industry, defects like pores and cracks can be disastrous causing the cast product 
to be rejected. If possible, the product is reheated, remelted and then cast again. Otherwise it is scrapped.
From an economic point view, these operations are very expensive.

\subsection*{Hot tearing} 
% --------------------------

Hot tearing, also denoted solidification cracking or hot cracking, occurs in the mushy zone 
at high solid fractions when a failure or crack appears in the cast part. 
They refer to liquid regions enclosed in the solid, where feeding stops. 
Preferential sites for crack initiation are localised in regions where liquid feeding is difficult.
The volume change combined with thermal stresses or external 
strains, may lead to cracks as shows \cref{fig:crack}. 
The temperature range in which the steel is vulnerable to hot tearing is known as the brittle 
temperature range, where the solid fraction is typically greater than \num{90}\%.

% --------------------------
%reference: \url{http://www.afsinc.org/about/content.cfm?ItemNumber=6933} \\
%reference: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting_defect} \\
 
Porosity is a void defect formed inside the casting or at the outer surface. 
It may be attributed to two different factors.
Firstly, we speak of \emph{shrinkage porosity}, when a void forms as a result of density 
differences between the liquid and its surrounding dendritic solid network, the latter being generally denser 
than the former. After solidification is complete, the casting surface may look like \cref{fig:porosity}.
The second factor is the presence of dissolved gaseous phases in the melt, and is referred to as \emph{gas porosity}. 
According to \citet{dantzig_solidification_2009}, these gases may be initially in the melt, or created by the 
reaction between the metal and water found in the air or trapped in grooves at the moulds surface. Providing sufficient cooling
and pressure drop in the liquid, the latter becomes supersaturated. 
The nucleation of a gaseous phase is then triggered.

%(just like when a cold bottle of coca-cola is opened !).

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Freckles or segregated channels} 
% --------------------------
 
The origin of this defect, shown in \cref{fig:freckle}, is a combined effet of microsegregation, buoyancy forces and
fragmentation of the dendritic network. 
%Upon solidification, solid forms while exchanging solutes with the liquid due to partitioning.
%(steels have a partition coefficient less than unity).
For a solute species that preferentially segregates into the liquid (partition coefficient less than unity)
and locally reduce the liquid density, a solutal driving force is created inside the mushy zone, generating convection currents, 
with "plume" shapes as often reported in the literature \citep{sarazin_studies_1992, schneider_modeling_1997,
saad_simulation_2015}. Temperature gradient is often an additional force of convection as the liquid density is also temperature-dependent, 
the resulting driving force being thus qualified as "thermosolutal". 

Equiaxed grains shown in \cref{fig:freckle}, are the growth result from free floating dendrite fragments in the solute-rich liquid channel. 
As solute accumulates in these areas, the thermosolutal convection is sustained, hence the channel solidification is delayed. 
This leads to the formation of a distinct crystal chain pattern, the so-called \emph{freckle}, once the segregated channel completely solidifies.  
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


%\subsection{Investment casting}
%
% This process is widely used to cast single-crystal (SC) alloys for turbines and other applications 
% that require excellent mechanical behavior \citep{giamei_nature_1970}.
% When performed by directional solidification, thermosolutal forces thrust segregated species outside of the 
% mushy zone into the liquid bulk. The segregation scale ranges from a few dendrites to a few hundreds 
% of them, hence forming "long and narrow trails" (\cref{fig:freckle1}) as described by \citet{felicelli_simulation_1991}. 
% Freckles are frequently formed by small equiaxed grains (\cref{fig:freckle2}), probably caused by a uniform temperature gradient 
% that settles as the channels become richer in solute. They can be observed on the ingot's surface, as well as in the volume.

\section{Industrial Worries}
%*********************************

Steel production has continuously increased over the years to meet the industrial needs. 
\Cref{fig:steel_production} shows this increase between 1980 and 2013 with a 
clear rise of the Chinese production. Quality constraints have also increased where specific 
grades of steel are needed in critical applications such as mega-structures
in construction and  heavy machinery. Other domains like the nuclear, are good examples showing the relevance of macrosegregation
studies in developing nuclear components for the new generation Evolutionary Power Reactor, manufactured by Areva. Therefore, alloys with defects are considered vulnerable 
and should be avoided as much as possible during the casting process. As such, steel makers have been investing
in research, with the aim of understanding better the phenomena leading to casting problems, 
and improve the processes when possible.

Simulation software dedicated to alloy casting is one of the main research investments undertaken by steelmakers. 
These tools originating from academic research, are actively used to optimize the process. 
However, few are the tools that take into account the casting environment. 
For instance, the continuous casting process, is a chain process where the last steps involve rolling, heat treatments, forging, etc. The continuous casting
machine itself not only consists of an open mould where solidification starts, but also includes rolls, water sprays and other components. 
A dedicated software is one that can provide the geometric requirements with suitable meshing capabilities, 
as well as respond to metallurgical and mechanical requirements, mainly by handling:
%
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item moulds and their interaction with the alloy (thermal resistances ...)
\item alloy filling and predicting velocity in the liquid and mushy zone
\item thermomechanical stresses in the solid
\item multicomponent alloys and predicting macrosegregation
\item microstructure and phases
\item finite solute diffusion in solid phases
\item real alloy properties (not just constant thermophysical/thermomechanical properties)
\item ..., etc
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Context}
%*********************************
The European Space Agency (ESA) has been actively committed, since its foundation in 1975, to research.
It covers not only exclusive space applications, but also fundamental science like solidification. 
This thesis takes part in the ESA project entitled \ccemlcc, abbreviating
"\textbf{C}hill \textbf{C}ooling for the \textbf{E}lectro-\textbf{M}agnetic \textbf{L}evitator in relation with 
\textbf{C}ontinuous \textbf{C}asting of steel".
The three-year project from late 2011 to late 2014 denoted \ccemlcc II, was preceded by an initial project phase, \ccemlcc I,
from 2007 to 2009. The main focus is studying containerless solidification of steel under microgravity conditions. 
A chill plate is used to extract heat from the alloy, simulating the contact effect with a mould in continuous casting
or ingot casting.
A partnership of 7 industrial and academic entities was formed in \ccemlcc II. 
Here is a brief summary of each partner's commitment:\\

\textbf{Academic partners} 
 \begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item Center for Material Forming (CEMEF) - France: numerical modelling of microgravity chill cooling experiments
\item Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR or German Aerospace Centre) and Ruhr Universität Bochum (RUB) university - Germany:  preparation of a chill cooling device 
for electromagnetic levitation (EML), microgravity testing and investigation of growth kinetics 
in chill-cooled and undercooled steel alloys
\item University of Alberta - Canada: impulse atomization and spray deposition of the D2 tool steel 
\item University of Bremen - Institut für Werkstofftechnik (IWT) institute - Germany: 
study of D2 tool steel melt solidification in atomization processing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Industrial partners}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item ARCELORMITTAL (France): elaboration of a series of steel grades used in microgravity and ground-based studies and characterisations.
\item METSO Minerals Inc.  (Finland): material production with D2 tool steel for spray forming
\item TRANSVALOR (France): development and marketing of the casting simulation software \thercast
\end{itemize}

CEMEF, as an academic partner, contributed to the work by proposing numerical models in view of predicting the chill cooling of steel droplets. 
A first model was developed by \citet{rivaux_simulation_2011}. 
The experimental work by DLR considered various facilities and environments to set a droplet of molten alloy in levitation: 
EML (\cref{fig:eml}) for ground-based experiments, 
microgravity during parabolic flight or sounding rockets and last, microgravity condition on-board the International Space Station (ISS).

\subsection{Ojectives and outline}
%*********************************
The present thesis has two main objectives. 
The first objective is predicting macrosegregation assuming a constant metal volume where solid phases are fixed, i.e. no account of solid 
transport (e.g. equiaxed crystals sedimentation) and rigid, hence no account of solid deformation. At CEMEF, this scope has been adopted in previous 
studies by \citet{gouttebroze_modelisation_2005, liu_finite_2005, mosbah_multiple_2008, rivaux_simulation_2011, carozzani_developpement_2012}.
Nevertheless, many modelling features evolved with time such as going from two-dimensional to three-dimensional modelling, resolution schemes
for each of the conservation equations: energy, chemical species and liquid momentum, Eulerian or Lagrangian descriptions, 
modelling of grain structure and others.
In this work, we propose a numerical model that relies on the previously mentioned developments
to predict macrosegregation, by furthermore taking into account
i) the energy conservation in a temperature formulation based on a thermodynamic database mapping,
ii) the liquid momentum conservation with thermosolutal convection as driving forces, %and solidification shrinkage 
iii) solidification paths at full equilibrium for multicomponent alloys. 
% iii) solute mass conservation with solidification shrinkage to predict inverse segregation and 
The second objective which is the novelty of the current work with respect to the predecessors,
is predicting macrosegregation while the metal undergoes solidification shrinkage, hence
its volume decreases with time, modifying the shape of the free metal surface in contact with ambient gas,
Subsequently, inverse segregation is studied. In this context, all conservation equations are reformulated 
in a Eulerian description while using the level set method to keep 
track of the boundary separating the alloy from the surrounding gas. 

To the author's knowledge, this work 
combining macrosegregation prediction using the level set methodology to track the metal-air boundary during 
shrinkage has no precedent in casting and solidification literature. The model couples in a weak fashion, all four
conservation equations presented in \cref{fig:mindmap}, showing on the one hand, that microsegregation is an essential 
common link between these equations, while on the other hand, the level set interacts with conservations equations by
giving the boundary position. 
%
\subsubsection{Numerical tools}
The current thesis developments are done using C++ language as a part of the
in-house code, known as \cimlib \citep{digonnet_cimlib:_2007,mesri_advanced_2009}. 
It is a finite element library with an object-oriented hierarchy
consisting of global finite element solvers for physical differential equations, also point-wise and element-wise solvers for 
preprocessing and post-processing the finite element solution. It is also designed with a highly parallel architecture with MPICH2, which makes it possible
to handle large meshes with heavy operations. Side utilities for plotting and analysis
are also developed, using python language.

\subsubsection{Content outline}
This manuscript consists of 5 chapters. In \textbf{chapter 2}, a short review introduces the state-of-art in the literature of 
macroscopic modelling of solidification with transport of energy, species, mass and momentum. \textbf{Chapter 3} provides details
of the energy conservation equation and introduces a new temperature-based solver compatible with thermodynamic databases,
% to predict, at equilibrium, variable solidification paths during macrosegregation.
\textbf{Chapter 4} focuses on the mass and momentum conservation equations 
and their derivation in the context of a single metallic domain (i.e. without 
the level set method) where the solid is assumed a fixed and rigid body. As an 
application, this chapter shows a breakthrough comparison between purely macroscopic 
and mesoscopic-macroscopic approaches in predicting the hydrodynamic instabilities 
that lead to channel segregation.
The derived energy, mass and momentum equations for the monodomain model are revisited 
in \textbf{chapter 5} in the context of the level set method to take into account solidification shrinkage.
The influence of shrinkage on macrosegregation is then studied in two different applications.
