	abstract = {A new crystal growth process, based on the Bridgman method, but with the aim to avoid crystal crucible contact, has been studied and implemented. The principle is to impose a gas pressure at the cold part of the crucible, approximately equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the molten sample, in order to get a small liquid meniscus between the solid–liquid interface and the crucible. A first-order capillary stability analysis shows that stable conditions can be reached for the growth of semiconductors by this technique. The relevant technical parameters were computed for the growth of antimonide semiconductors and contactless samples of these materials have been obtained in silica crucibles. They show surface roughness close to what is generally observed when dewetted growth occurs in space.},

	abstract = {A diffuse interface model is derived for the direct simulation of two-phase flows with surface tension, phase-change, and density and viscosity differences between the phases. The derivation starts from the balance equations for a sharp interface and uses an ensemble averaging procedure on an atomic scale to obtain a diffuse interface version of the equations. As opposed to thermodynamically derived models, the two phases are assumed to coexist inside the diffuse interface with different properties, velocities, and pressures. Separate conservation equations are solved for each phase. The phase interactions are modeled explicitly through the inclusion of interfacial forces in the momentum equations for each phase. Based on a superposition of microscopic (atomic-scale) and macroscopic interface morphologies, an expression for the interfacial momentum source due to surface tension is introduced that is equivalent to the capillary stress term encountered in thermodynamically derived models. Also, a constitutive relation for the average viscous stresses of each phase inside the diffuse interface is presented. The model is tested for simple one-dimensional flows tangential and normal to a diffuse interface, and the results are compared to those obtained from a thermodynamically derived model.},

The model links a previously developed thermodynamic phase equilibrium subroutine with an existing code for simultaneously solving the macroscopic mass, momentum, energy, and species conservation equations for solidification of a multicomponent alloy. Simulation results are presented for a variety of casting speeds and imposed thermal gradients and for two alloy compositions. It is found that for a given alloy composition, the onset of convection and freckle formation occurs at a critical primary dendrite arm spacing, which agrees well with previous experimental findings. The predicted number and shape of the freckle chains in the unstable cases also agree qualitatively with experimental observations. Finally, it is demonstrated how the onset and nature of convection and macrosegregation vary with alloy composition. It is concluded that the present model can provide a valuable tool in predicting freckle defects in directional solidification of Ni-base superalloys.},

Measurements have been made of plume-channel compositions and those of their surroundings, by direct sampling of transparent liquids and by electron microprobe analysis of fully solidified metallic alloys, after the events. Plume liquid temperatures were also measured in the transparent materials and flow rates were measured from video records of particle movements. The plume-channel widths and spacings are remarkably similar in all these materials despite their physical differences. Analysis shows that the flow rates for the transparent systems fit a Poiseuille relation, modified for slip at the plume boundaries. Extrapolation of this analysis, using measured channel compositions and estimated buoyancy terms, predicts plume flow velocities in metals to lie between 1.10−1 and 2.10−1 m. s−1. The factors that determine the pattern selection of the plume-channel dimensions, compositions and flow rates are discussed with reference to thermal equilibrium, the onset of turbulence and the restrictions to the liquid re-entrainment needed to sustain such flow.},

The proposed method starts by the use of a finite element variational multiscale ({VMS}) method, which consists in here of a decomposition for both the velocity and the pressure fields into coarse/resolved scales and fine/unresolved scales. This choice of decomposition is shown to be favorable for simulating flows at high Reynolds number. We explore the behaviour and accuracy of the proposed approximation on three test cases. First, the lid-driven square cavity at Reynolds number up to 50,000 is compared with the highly resolved numerical simulations and second, the lid-driven cubic cavity up to Re = 12,000 is compared with the experimental data. Finally, we study the flow over a 2D backward-facing step at Re = 42,000. Results show that the present implementation is able to exhibit good stability and accuracy properties for high Reynolds number flows with unstructured meshes.},

The data are used in regression analyses and simple flow models to arrive at relationships between permeability and the morphology of the solid dendrites. When flow is parallel to the primary dendrite arms, the important morphological aspects are the volume fraction liquid (g L) and the primary dendrite arm spacing (d 1). When flow is normal to the primary dendrite arms, the permeability depends upon the secondary dendrite arm spacing (d 2) as well asd 1 andg L. The parallel permeability is best described by a model based on the Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar flow through a tube; for the normal permeability an empirical multilinear regression gives the best fit to the data. However, those models are not appropriate for extrapolations beyond the range of the available data (0.19≤g L≤0.66), particularly asg L approaches 1. For extrapolations, models based upon the Blake-Kozeny equation for flow through porous media are recommended.},

The role of finger convection and remelting on the structure of a mushy layer containing channels is studied. The numerical simulation is performed using a fixed-grid single-domain approach in which local remelting and anisotropic variation of mush permeability are taken into account. It is observed that solute-rich liquid rising in the form of finger convection causes delayed growth and localized remelting of portions of the solid/mush interface, resulting in patches of thin structure known as channels. The present study reveals the manner in which the structure of a mushy layer evolves during channel formation. Effects of bulk liquid convection on channel formation, evolution, destruction and the resulting effect on the mush structure are found to be significant. Numerical prediction with regard to variation of the number of channels with time agrees qualitatively with published experimental results.},

Other key features, such as freckle channel width and critical Rayleigh number, also correlated well. The validated model was used to investigate freckle formation under a range of solidification conditions. Two distinct stages of freckle onset were observed, identified via the dendrite tip growth and solute profiles. The first stage corresponds to lower flow velocities with large fluctuations; in the second stage the velocities stabilize, with established recirculating flows forming solute channels. The influence of imperfections in dendritic morphology, such as grain boundaries and primary spacing variations, on the critical Rayleigh number was studied. It was found that that these features initiate freckles. Non-intuitively, converging grain boundaries were observed to have the greatest propensity for freckle formation.

A recently introduced algorithm was used to calculate the complicated solidification path of alloys of many components, which can accommodate liquidus temperatures that are general functions of liquid concentrations. The calculations are started from an all-liquid state, and the growth of the mushy zone is followed in time. Simulations of a Ni-Al-Ta-W alloy were performed on a rectangular cylinder until complete solidification. The results reveal details of the formation of freckles not previously observed in two-dimensional simulations. Liquid plumes in the form of chimney convection emanate from channels within the mushy zone, with similar qualitative features previously observed in transparent systems. Associated with the formation of channels, there is a complex three-dimensional flow produced by the interaction of the different solutal buoyancies of the alloy solutes. Regions of enhanced solid growth develop around the channel mouths, which are visualized as volcanoes on top of the mushy zone. The prediction of volcanoes differs from our previous calculations with multicomponent alloys in two dimensions, in which the volcanoes were not nearly as apparent.

Elle est liée à l'incapacité du liquide de s'écouler dans les zones où des porosités sont présentes, ne permettant pas de les refermer avant qu'elles gagnent en volume. Pour comprendre la fissuration à chaud, il est crucial de développer nos connaissances du comportement mécanique de la zone pâteuse. Pour cela, il est très utile d'effectuer des expériences de microtomographie aux rayons X et des simulations mécaniques sur des volumes élémentaires représentatifs. Dans cette thèse, nous proposons de coupler les deux approches en initialisant une simulation par éléments finis grâce à des données de microtomographie issues d'un test de traction isotherme d'un alliage d'aluminium-cuivre à l'état pâteux. Cette approche originale nous donne directement accès à la réalité expérimentale et permet des comparaisons des évolutions numérique et expérimentale de l'éprouvette. Nous expliquons dans un premier temps comment obtenir la représentation numérique à l'aide de l'algorithme des marching cubes et de la méthode d'immersion de volume. Nous présentons ensuite notre modèle numérique qui s'appuie sur une résolution monolithique des équations de Stokes. Une fois le champ de vitesse obtenu dans l'ensemble des phases solide, liquide et gazeuse, nous utilisons une méthode level set dans un formalisme eulérien afin de faire évoluer la morphologie de notre échantillon numérique. Malgré la simplicité du modèle, les résultats expérimentaux et numériques montrent un accord raisonnable en ce qui concerne la propagation de l'air à l'intérieur de l'échantillon.},

	abstract = {A coupled Cellular Automaton ({CA})–Finite Element ({FE}) model is presented for the prediction of solidification grain structures coupled with the calculation of solid and liquid flow induced macrosegregation. The model is applied to simulate the solidification of a Pb–48wt\%Sn alloy in a rectangular cavity cooled down from only one of its vertical boundaries. The algorithm and the numerical implementation of the coupling between the {CA} and {FE} methods are first validated by considering a single grain developing with no undercooling. Such a {CAFE} simulation is shown to retrieve the solution of a purely {FE} method simulation for which the grain structure is not accounted for. Several applications of the model are then presented to quantify the effects of the grain structure on the final macrosegregation map. In particular, the effect of the undercooling of the columnar front, the presence of equiaxed grains nucleated in the undercooled liquid, as well as the transport and sedimentation of equiaxed grains are investigated. Although good validation is reached when comparing computed and measured segregation profiles available in the literature for the chosen configuration, it is concluded that refined experimental data are required to further validate the predictions of a coupled {CAFE} model.},

It is used here for the first time to track the interface evolution during the process of casting a second alloy into mold, partly displacing the first to achieve a casing with a different alloyed skin. Projection method for Navier–Stokes equations was adopted and the algorithm was implemented in finite element method. The numerical example shows that though in those cases where the layer of liquid metal above is lighter than that below, the interface is not always stable for density ratios less than one of the two liquid metals. The stability of the interface is sensitive to the density ratio and inlet velocity and relatively insensitive to the viscosity ratio or other parameters. It is believed that level set method has potential to be further used in real double casting processes.},

	abstract = {Les macroségrégations sont des hétérogénéités de répartition des espèces chimiques en peau ou à coeur des produits sidérurgiques. Ces macroségrégations peuvent engendrer de sévères problèmes dans la chaîne de transformation aval. Contrairement à la plupart des études qui s'intéressent aux macroségrégations centrales, nos travaux portent sur la simulation des macroségrégations en peau induites par déformations thermomécaniques. La simulation a été construite en trois étapes. La première étape consiste à simuler la macroségrégation en l'absence de toute déformation du solide, c'est-à-dire à solide fixe et rigide. La deuxième étape, indépendante de la première, revient à calculer uniquement la déformation du solide. Enfin, la dernière étape correspond à la réunion des deux premières. Les équations du problème sont résolues grâce à la méthode des éléments finis à laquelle sont adjointes des méthodes de stabilisation. Pour chacune des étapes, les simulations se basent sur des expériences. Pour la première étape, la validation s'appuie sur l'expérience de Hebditch \& Hunt. Les résultats numériques et expérimentaux concordent. L'expérience qui sert de point de comparaison pour la deuxième étape est l'expérience de la déformation d'une goutte de métal liquide lors de son refroidissement par une plaque en cuivre. Cette expérience a été mise en place par un des partenaires du projet et s'est déroulée en microgravité. La déformation numérique obtenue suit la même tendance que celle de l'expérience mais avec une intensité inférieure. La dernière étape s'est appuyée sur l'expérience de refroidissement pulsé d'un lingot effectuée par El-Bealy. La simulation prévoit des variations de ségrégation mais n'arrive pas à capter toutes les variations expérimentales, conséquences de la déformation du solide. Des calculs sans thermomécanique montrent que notre simulation semble moins sensible à la déformation que l'expérience. L'ensemble des simulations a mis en jeu des alliages binaires. Un cas de solidification d'alliage ternaire sans déformation du solide a été simulé.},

On the microscopic scale the model takes into account nucleation, finite diffusion in both solid and liquid phases, and resolves the diffusion-controlled phase change by a solute balance at the solid–liquid interface coupled with a thermodynamic equilibrium condition for the interface. The main idea of the paper is the solution algorithm of the multiscale model. We propose and present in detail an operator splitting method that resolves the global conservation equations in two stages. In the first solution stage we resolve and integrate globally only the convection terms. In the second solution stage we resolve and integrate locally the contributions of the grain growth kinetics, i.e. the phase change and the microscopic diffusion. We analyze this splitting method based on a scaling analysis that shows that the justification of the method stems from the separation of time scales of convection, diffusion and phase change. We discuss this scale separation in detail and define a test case that is presented and analyzed in a companion paper.},

Phase boundaries are tracked by solving the multi-phase level set equations. Diffused interfaces are constructed from these tracked phase boundaries using the level set functions. Based on the assumed diffused interfaces, volume-averaging techniques are applied for energy, species and momentum transport. Microstructure evolution in multi-component alloy systems is predicted using realistic material parameters. The methodology avoids the difficulty of parameter identification needed in other diffused interface models, and allows easy application to various practical alloy systems. Techniques including fast marching, narrow band computing and adaptive meshing are utilized to speed up computations. Several numerical examples are considered to validate the method and examine its potential for modeling solidification of practical alloy systems. These examples include two- and three-dimensional solidification of a binary alloy in an undercooled melt, a study of planar/cellular/dendritic transition in the solidification of a Ni–Cu alloy, and eutectic and peritectic solidification of an Fe–C system. Adaptive mesh refinement in the rapidly varying interface region makes the method practical for coupling the microstructure evolution at the meso-scale with buoyancy driven flow in the macro-scale, which is shown in the solidification of a Ni–Al–Ta ternary alloy.},

The benchmark quantities: circularity, center of mass, and mean rise velocity are defined and measured to monitor convergence toward a reference solution. Comprehensive studies are undertaken by three independent research groups, two representing Eulerian level set finite-element codes and one representing an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian moving grid approach. The first benchmark test case considers a bubble with small density and viscosity ratios, which undergoes moderate shape deformation. The results from all codes agree very well allowing for target reference values to be established. For the second test case, a bubble with a very low density compared to that of the surrounding fluid, the results for all groups are in good agreement up to the point of break up, after which all three codes predict different bubble shapes. This highlights the need for the research community to invest more effort in obtaining reference solutions to problems involving break up and coalescence. Other research groups are encouraged to participate in these benchmarks by contacting the authors and submitting their own data.

	abstract = {A three-phase mixed columnar-equiaxed solidification model is used to calculate the macrosegregation in a 2.45 ton steel ingot. The main features of mixed columnar-equiaxed solidification in such an ingot can be quantitatively modelled: growth of columnar dendrite trunks; nucleation, growth and sedimentation of equiaxed crystals; thermosolutal convection of the melt; solute transport by both convection and crystal sedimentation; and the columnar-to-equiaxed transition ({CET}). The predicted as-cast macrostructure and the segregation pattern are in qualitative agreement with the reported experimental results. Parameter study on the numerical grid size and the nucleation of the equiaxed crystals are performed, and some segregation mechanisms are numerically analyzed. Discontinued positive–negative segregation just below the hot top is predicted because of the formation of a local mini-ingot and the subsequent sedimentation of equiaxed grains within the mini-ingot. Quasi A-segregates in the middle radius region between the casting outer surface and the centreline are also found. The quasi A-segregates originate from the flow instability, but both the appearance of equiaxed crystals and their interaction with the growing columnar dendrite tips significantly strengthen the segregates. The appearance of equiaxed phase is not a necessary condition for the formation of quasi A-segregates. The quantitative discrepancy between the predicted and experimental results is also discussed.},

The present paper proposes a numerical analysis for the formation of freckles using the three dimensional (3D) cellular automaton ({CA}) – finite element ({FE}) model [1]. The model integrates kinetics laws for the nucleation and growth of a microstructure to the solution of the conservation equations for the casting, while introducing an intermediate modeling scale for a direct representation of the envelope of the dendritic grains. Directional solidification of a cuboid cell is studied. Its geometry, the alloy chosen as well as the process parameters are inspired from experimental observations recently reported in the literature [2]. Snapshots of the convective pattern, the solute distribution and the morphology of the growth front are qualitatively compared. Similitudes are found when considering the coupled 3D {CAFE} simulations. Limitations of the model to reach direct simulation of the experiments are discussed.},

	abstract = {A criterion for predicting the formation of freckles for Pb-Sn and Ni-base superalloys is evaluated using available experimental data. The criterion is based on a maximum value of the Rayleigh number, which indicates that the magnitude of buoyancy forces is largest with respect to the retarding frictional forces. The definition of the Rayleigh number involves a characteristic length scale. The two options explored in this study are the distance from the liquid mush interface and the scale represented by the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed. Additionally, two alternative ways of computing the mushy-zone permeability are explored. Only two of the possible combinations of length scales and permeability relations provide a maximum value within the mush that can be chosen as a representative value for the given conditions. It is found that the Rayleigh number that uses the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed as a length scale provides the best separation between freckled and nonfreckled data. Critical values for the Rayleigh number are in the range of 38 to 46 for vertically solidified Pb-Sn and within the range of 30 to 33 for Ni-base superalloys. Although not exactly the same, the proximity of these intervals indicates that the critical Rayleigh number is not very sensitive to alloy-specific system parameters. The influence of sample pulling inclination angle on this critical value is assessed for Ni-base superalloys. A preliminary relationship between the critical Rayleigh number and the inclination angle is developed.},

In situ characterization of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition in a refined Al–3.5 wt.\% Ni alloy is achieved by synchrotron X-ray radiography. Two main characteristics are derived from the radiographs for each nucleated grain, namely the nucleation position in the sample and the orientation of the main trunk relative to the vertical temperature gradient. These data are then used as input for the {CA}-{FE} simulations. The {CA}-{FE} model takes into account the effects of macroscopic transport of heat, liquid momentum and solute mass on the development of the dendritic grain structure and vice versa. The influence of convection on macroscopic shape of the growth front, the grain structure, the microstructure distribution and macro-segregation is determined by a comparison between the experimental observations and results from the numerical simulations with and without fluid flow. Good qualitative agreement is obtained and limitations that are linked to the two-dimensional approximation and the need for direct tracking of the eutectic grain structure are pointed out.},

	abstract = {The breakdown of single-crystal solidification has been studied over a wide range of solidification conditions in ten superalloys with large variations in Re, Ta, and W content. Over the range of experimental conditions investigated, grain defect formation was sensitive to local thermaland solutal conditions. For a fixed alloy composition and withdrawal rate, the transition from single-crystal to equiaxed solidification did not occur abruptly. Instead, as thermal gradients were decreased in a series of experiments, isolated, highly misoriented columnar grains with the same composition as that of the base alloy developed in the presence of positive (stabilizing) thermal gradients with increasing frequency until the advance of the single-crystal front was completely blocked. The onset of columnar grain formation occurred when the primary dendrite arm spacing exceeded a critical value, corresponding to a morphological transition in the dendritic array. The onset of “freckling” was observed at the same primary dendrite arm spacing where misoriented columnar grains began to appear. In experiments with varying levels of refractory alloy content, there was also a strong correlation between the onset of grain formation and freckle formation. These observations strongly suggest that in high refractory content superalloys, the breakdown of single-crystal solidification and the formation of misoriented grains as well as freckle-type defects are sensitively dependent on thermosolutal convection processes.},

hardening elements (e.g. Al \& Ti), for a conventionally cast

prime, this class of alloys has increased susceptibility for the 
formation of melt segregation defects, such as freckles. The 
propensity for freckle formation is further aggravated by the need 
for larger diameter ingots to support the trend toward higher 
thrust large diameter fan engines used on wide body twin engine 
aircraft. A review and assessment of production quality control 
techniques for freckle inspection are discussed. An in depth 
microstructural, chemical, and structural characterization is

En considérant des flux de diffusion finis, des cinétiques de réactions dendritique, péritectique et eutectique et des surfusions de germination, une alternative plus évoluée est proposée aux modèles de Gulliver-Scheil ou de la loi des leviers. Le couplage avec des calculs d'équilibre thermodynamique est effectué pour évaluer les compositions des interfaces et les termes d'enthalpie dans le bilan d'énergie. Le modèle est appliqué à un alliage binaire, avec des densités de phases constantes, pour simuler le procédé d'atomisation de gouttes d'alliage Al-Ni. Un modèle dédié est choisi pour les conditions aux limites d'échange de chaleur. Les résultats sont comparés à des mesures expérimentales obtenues par diffraction de neutron. Des interprétations sont alors établies sur les comportements non triviaux des alliages Al-Ni solidifiés rapidement. Le modèle proposé permet ainsi d'appréhender les effets concurrents des différentes cinétiques (diffusion chimique, bilan d'énergie, vitesse croissance des microstructures, etc.) lors de la solidification hors équilibre. Les principaux développements envisageables autour de ce travail incluent : l'extension aux alliages multicomposés, l'inclusion de densités variables, le couplage avec des calculs macroscopiques.},

	abstract = {This work first presents a new multi-scales modeling approach of grain structures solidification and its associated segregation pattern in the as-cast state. It is based upon a semi-analytical description of the chemical length scales built in the solid and outside the envelope of the grains. Originality lies in the account of both the primary and the eutectic structure nucleation undercooling. The model has been applied for Al–Cu sample with spontaneous nucleation processed by the Electromagnetic Levitation ({EML}) technique. The {EML} technique is used as an experimental model to process Aluminum–Copper spherical samples with different copper compositions. For each sample, nucleation has been either spontaneous or triggered using an alumina plate. Various degrees of undercooling have been measured prior to the primary and the eutectic structure nucleation events. Extensive metallurgical characterizations have been performed over a median cutting plane for each sample using a scanning electron microscope({SEM}) equipped with energy–dispersive X-ray spectrometry and analyses of {SEM} images. A complete set of data has been elaborated consisting of the distribution maps drawn for the average copper composition, the volume fraction of the eutectic structure, the dendrite arm spacing and their averaged values over the same cutting plane. Segregation has been measured and found to be strongly correlated with the eutectic and the dendrite arm spacing maps. Application of the model shows that the nucleation undercooling of the eutectic structure is a key parameter for a quantitative prediction of the fraction of phases in the solidified samples. In addition, a two-dimensional Cellular Automaton - Finite Element (2D {CAFE}) model is developed to investigate the segregation maps and the non-equilibrium temperature evolution for samples with spontaneous and triggered nucleation. The model integrates the microsegregation model in each {CA} cell taking into account the primary phase nucleation undercooling and back diffusion in the solid phase. Additional microstructural features considered are the primary and the secondary dendrite arm spacing. Heat, mass and momentum conservation equations over the simulation domain are solved using the finite element model. A new coupling scheme between the finite element and the cellular automaton model is developed allowing finite element mesh adaptation. A geometrical error estimator has been integrated in the finite element model to control the mesh size and orientation in order to increase the accuracy of the finite element solution. New interpretations of the experimental observations are accessible thanks to the new 2D {CAFE} model. The 2D {CAFE} model is also successfully applied to a benchmark solidification test developed recently for a rectangular cavity experiment. Comparisons with maps of temperature, macrosegregation and grains structures have been performed demonstrating the model capabilities to deal with heat and mass exchanges at micro and macro scales.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional solidification model has been developed to study the directional solidification of dendritic alloys. It is based on the resolution of the heat flow equation using a two-interface front tracking technique. The two interfaces are defined by imaginary limits, assumed to be macroscopically flat, which correspond to the positions of the growing dendritic and eutectic interfaces. These delimit the three regions that are considered: liquid, mushy zone and solid. Growth kinetics laws are applied to the interfaces by velocity vs temperature relationships. It was found that, if complete solidification was carried out directionally up to the top of the ingot (i.e. formation of a fully columnar structure), then the velocity of the dendrite tips first increased during the stage of the superheat loss, then decreased when no substantial thermal gradient remained in the liquid ahead of the growing dendritic interface. Applied to directional solidification experiments carried out with aluminium–silicon alloys, the model shows that this maximum velocity was reached when the top position of the mushy zone (i.e. the dendritic interface) reached about two-thirds the length of the ingots. This position being in the vicinity of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition ({CET}) observed in the longitudinal section of the ingots, a {CET} scenario is proposed based on a constrained-to-unconstrained growth transition, leading to breakdown of the columnar dendritic front.},

The present work attempts mass and volume conservation law-based derivation of the {LS} advection equation and the continuity equation, respectively, for two-phase flow with phase change. Physical interpretation of the Heaviside function and the Dirac delta function, used in the {LS} method, is done here in a novel way and the resulting expressions are used in the derivations. The diffused interface, used in the {LS} method, is shown to introduce negligible error on a sufficiently fine grid.},

	url = {http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00001339},
	abstract = {This work is dedicated to the modeling of macrosegregation and deformation during solidification of
castings. A two-dimensional finite element model to simulate macrosegregation due to thermal-solutal
convection in the case of columnar dendritic solidification is presented. A set of volume-averaged
conservation equations of energy, solute, momentum and mass is solved in conjunction with the use of the
lever rule as a microsegregation model. Several formulations have been implemented, permitting a
resolution with either weak or strong coupling, closed or open system. In order to improve the prediction
accuracy, an algorithm for dynamic remeshing is proposed. The basic idea is to generate fine elements near
the liquidus isotherm. The norm of the gradient of solid fraction is used for piloting the remeshing in the
mushy zone; while the objective mesh size in the liquid is considered as a function of the distance to the
liquidus isotherm.
The numerical approach has been validated with a benchmark test of macrosegregation in Pb-Sn
alloys taken from the literature. The influences of mesh size, time step and coupling scheme have been
investigated. Sufficient fine meshes, small time step and possibly coupling iterations should be applied in
order to predict segregated channels. Moreover, the efficiency of mesh adaptation is demonstrated by
predictions of freckles in a case of unidirectional solidification, and of ‘A-type’ segregation bands in a large
industrial carbon steel ingot.
In the last part of this work, regarding fluid flow in the liquid induced by solidification
shrinkage and thermo-convection and deformation in the solid, a thermal mechanical model has
been implemented with a Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation. The alloy in the liquid state is
Newtonian, and in the mushy state it is modeled by a viscoplastic continuum. Below a critical
temperature the alloy is considered by a thermal elastic viscoplastic model. The thermo-mechanical
simulation is used to predict the shrinkage pipe, air gap, strains and stresses.},

As the growth proceeded, one grain was selected in each sample and the growth finished with a single crystal. X-ray analysis has shown that, in the zone where there was no contact with the crucible, the structural quality continuously improved. Chemical segregation obtained in space is representative of a diffusive regime of transport in the melt, in spite of the low growth rate used. This differs from ground experiments which are under convective conditions. Measurements of electrical properties have given results comparable to that of standard samples obtained on earth, but with a rather lower electrical resistivity.},

The results indicate that the extent and intensity of the centreline segregation is modified via the grain-refinement treatment: the finer the grains are, the more intense is the macro-segregation.Numerical simulations of directional solidification of binary Al–Cu alloys have been carried out with the help of a 2D finite volume software which takes account of the movement of the liquid with respect to the solid in the mushy zone.

Another phenomena based on pressure differences between the hot and cold sides of the liquid can explain dewetting in the case of thermodynamic wetting angles, even in the case of metals and on the ground. The effect of various parameters such as contact angle, growing angle, crystal radius and pressure difference have been studied and a stability analysis has shown that the growth process is stable for high contact angles. For low contact angles, the growth is not stable, but the high pressure differences needed to get reasonable values of the gap thickness between the wall and the crucible can have a stabilizing effect.},

The model includes the heat transport in both the solid and liquid part, fluid flow in the liquid phase by the Navier–Stokes equations, tracking of the melt interface solid/liquid by the Stefan condition, treatment of the capillary boundary accounting for surface tension effects and a radiative boundary condition. We show that an accurate treatment of the moving boundaries is crucial to resolve their respective influences on the flow field and thus on the overall energy transport correctly. This is achieved by a mesh-moving method, which explicitly tracks the phase boundary and makes it possible to use a sharp interface model without singularities in the boundary conditions at the triple junction. A numerical example describing the welding of a thin-steel wire end by a laser, where all aforementioned effects have to be taken into account, proves the effectiveness of the approach.Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

En plus de la texture donnée au matériau, la germination et la croissance des grains sont liées en particulier avec la formation des phases thermodynamiques et les inhomogénéités en composition d'éléments d'alliage. La structure de grains est rarement modélisée à l'échelle macroscopique, d'autant plus que l'approximation 2D est très souvent injustifiée. Dans ces travaux, la germination et la croissance de chaque grain individuel sont suivies avec un modèle macroscopique 3D {CAFE}. La microstructure interne des grains n'est pas explicitement résolue. Pour valider les approximations faites sur cette microstructure, une comparaison directe avec un modèle microscopique 'champ de phase' a été réalisée. Celle-ci a permis de valider les hypothèses de construction du modèle {CAFE}, de mettre en avant le lien entre données calculées par les modèles microscopiques et paramètres d'entrée des modèles à plus grande échelle, et les domaines de validité de chaque modèle. Dans un deuxième temps, un couplage avec la ségrégation chimique et les bases de données thermodynamiques a été mise en place et appliquée sur un alliage binaire étain-plomb. Une expérience de macroségrégation par convection naturelle a été simulée. L'accord entre les courbes de température expérimentales et simulées atteint une précision de l'ordre de 1K, et la recalescence est correctement prédite. Les cartes de compositions sont comparables qualitativement, ainsi que la structure de grains. Les avantages du suivi de la structure ont été mis en évidence par rapport à une simulation par éléments finis classique. De plus, il a été montré que le calcul 3D était ici indispensable. Enfin, une implémentation parallèle optimisée du code a permis d'appliquer le modèle {CAFE} à un lingot de silicium polycristallin industriel de dimensions 0,192 x 0,192 x 2,08m, avec une taille de cellules de 250µm.

A new mechanism for the {CET} is proposed based on solutal interactions between the equiaxed grains and the advancing columnar front—as opposed to the commonly used mechanical blocking criterion. The resulting differences in the {CET} prediction are demonstrated for cases where a steady state can be assumed, and a revised isotherm velocity (V T ) vs temperature gradient (G) map for the {CET} is presented. The model is validated by predicting the {CET} in previously performed unsteady, unidirectional solidification experiments involving Al-Si alloys of three different compositions. Good agreement is obtained between measured and predicted cooling curves. A parametric study is performed to investigate the dependence of the {CET} position on the nucleation undercooling and the density of nuclei in the equiaxed zone. Nucleation undercoolings are determined that provide the best agreement between measured and calculated {CET} positions. It is found that for all three alloy compositions, the nucleation undercoolings are very close to the maximum columnar dendrite tip undercoolings, indicating that the origin of the equiaxed grains may not be heterogeneous nucleation, but rather a breakdown or fragmentation of the columnar dendrites.},

	abstract = {A new implementation of surface tension effects in interfacial flow codes is proposed which is both fully implicit in space, that is the interface never has to be reconstructed, and also semi-implicit in time, with semi-implicit referring to the time integration of the surface tension forces. The main idea is to combine two previously separate techniques to yield a new expression for the capillary forces. The first is the continuum surface force ({CSF}) method, which is used to regularize the discontinuous surface tension force term. The regularization can be elegantly implemented with the use of distance functions, which makes the level set method a suitable choice for the interface-tracking algorithm. The second is to use a finite element discretization together with the Laplace–Beltrami operator, which enables simple reformulation of the surface tension term into its semi-implicit equivalent. The performance of the new method is benchmarked against standard explicit methods, where it is shown that the new method is significantly more robust for the chosen test problems when the time steps exceed the numerical capillary time step restriction. Some improvements are also found in the average number of nonlinear iterations and linear multigrid steps taken while solving the momentum equations. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Inverse segregation was found to exist, and the extent of segregation in the first 50 pct of the ingot solidified agreed well with that calculated from inverse segregation theory based on the flowback of enriched liquid. However, at higher points in the ingot, the solute distribution deviated from the theoretical one. Also, more and bigger shrinkage pores existed in the equiaxed grained ingot than in a columnar grained ingot. It is suggested that the formation of randomly distributed, equiaxed grains restricts the flowback of enriched interdendritic liquid much more than the formation of columnar grains where interdendritic channels exist. In an equiaxed grained ingot solidified vertically from the bottom upward, the hydrostatic pressure becomes insufficient to cause complete flowback of enriched liquid in the latter stages of solidification. This effect causes porosity in the ingot and a solute distribution which deviates from that predicted by the theory of inverse segregation.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of a numerical criterion to provide quantitative insight on freckling conditions is critical to the successful manufacture of large superalloy castings. Of the criteria reported in the literature, those based on the Rayleigh number seem best suited to predict the onset of freckle formation. However, in their current form, these criteria cannot explain why freckles develop predominantly at the surface of single crystal ({SX}) castings and at midradius in {VAR}/{ESR} ingots. An experimental Bridgman-type furnace has been built to directionally solidify freckle-prone superalloys, {CMSX}-11B, {RENÉ}88, {NIM}80A, {WASPALOY}, {MAR}-M247, and a variation of {IN}718 with high silicon content, at various angles to the vertical. Under typical industrial solidification conditions (thermal gradient between 500 and 4000 K m−1 (5{\textless}G{\textless}40 °C cm−1) and solidification rate between 1.67×10−5 and 1.0×10−4 m s−1 (1{\textless}R{\textless}6mm min−1)), the results indicate a dependency of freckling on growth front angle likely related to the anisotropy in permeability. A modified Rayleigh criterion has been developed which accounts for directional permeability and orientation of the growth front relative to the gravity vector. Application to the experimental data shows good correlation with the onset of freckling for the range of solidification conditions examined in the study. The approximate threshold value for the modified Rayleigh number was estimated to be for {CMSX}-11B, 0.88, for {RENÉ}88, 0.90, for {NIM}80A, 0.85, for {WASPALOY}, 0.95, for {MAR}-M247, 0.86, and for {IN}718-Si, 0.65.},

	abstract = {A numerical method for the simulation of buoyancy-induced macrosegregation during solidification processes is presented. The physical model is based on volume averaged conservation equations for energy, mass, momentum, and solute. The resulting partial differential equations are solved by a finite element method, which considers two different length-scales: on the one hand, the scale of the overall process, on the other, a small critical zone near the solidification front where solutal inhomogeneities are initiated and the fluid velocity is non-zero. A domain decomposition method using two adapted grids has been developed. The overall computational domain is discretized using a `coarse' finite element mesh adapted to the process scale. At each time step, the energy conservation equation is solved using this discretization and new values of temperature and solid fraction are calculated at each finite element node. Based on these values, the computational domain is subdivided into three subdomains: the so-called solid, mushy, and liquid regions. The mushy subdomain corresponds to the critical zone near the solidification front and is adaptively discretized with a finer finite element mesh, whereas the liquid domain uses the initial coarse grid and the solid is no longer considered. The fluid flow and solute transport equations are then solved on the different meshes using a Dirichlet–Neumann substructuring iterative method, together with the mortar technique to deal with the non-conforming discretizations at the subdomain interfaces. The method is applied to several test problems such as the Hebditch–Hunt macrosegregation experiment or the prediction of freckles, and the performances and limits of the approach are pointed out and discussed.},

Defects such as A-segregates are still commonplace, and components are regularly scrapped due to their presence, leading to increased economic and environmental costs. With the growth of the nuclear power industry, and the increased demands placed on new pressure vessels, it is now more important than ever that today’s steel ingots are as chemically homogeneous as possible.This article briefly reviews the development of our current understanding of macrosegregation phenomena during the 20th century, before going on to assess the latest developments in the field of macrosegregation modelling. The aim of the text is to highlight the shortcomings of applying contemporary macromodels to steel-ingot casting, and to suggest practical alternatives.

	abstract = {In this paper we present a three-dimensional Navier–Stokes solver for incompressible two-phase flow problems with surface tension and apply the proposed scheme to the simulation of bubble and droplet deformation. One of the main concerns of this study is the impact of surface tension and its discretization on the overall convergence behavior and conservation properties. Our approach employs a standard finite difference/finite volume discretization on uniform Cartesian staggered grids and uses Chorin's projection approach. The free surface between the two fluid phases is tracked with a level set ({LS}) technique. Here, the interface conditions are implicitly incorporated into the momentum equations by the continuum surface force method. Surface tension is evaluated using a smoothed delta function and a third-order interpolation. The problem of mass conservation for the two phases is treated by a reinitialization of the {LS} function employing a regularized signum function and a global fixed point iteration. All convective terms are discretized by a {WENO} scheme of fifth order. Altogether, our approach exhibits a second-order convergence away from the free surface. The discretization of surface tension requires a smoothing scheme near the free surface, which leads to a first-order convergence in the smoothing region. We discuss the details of the proposed numerical scheme and present the results of several numerical experiments concerning mass conservation, convergence of curvature, and the application of our solver to the simulation of two rising bubble problems, one with small and one with large jumps in material parameters, and the simulation of a droplet deformation due to a shear flow in three space dimensions. Furthermore, we compare our three-dimensional results with those of quasi-two-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations. This comparison clearly shows the need for full three-dimensional simulations of droplet and bubble deformation to capture the correct physical behavior. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

After investigating droplet deposition onto a room temperature substrate, the effect of substrate preheating on residual thermal stresses is quantified. Also, deposition of a second droplet is modeled and the effect on residual stresses of localized preheating by the first deposited droplet is assessed. Temperature-dependent conductivity, specific heat and density are used in coupled thermal models of droplet and substrate domains. Mechanical models include temperature-dependent Young's modulus, linear expansion coefficient and creep. Two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric thermal and mechanical results are compared to one-dimensional (1D) results which approximate conditions along the droplet/substrate centerline. It is found that the more computationally efficient 1D models aid in interpreting the 2D results and provide reliable estimates of maximum stress magnitudes. Methods and results from this investigation are relevant to processes in which molten superheated metal contacts solid metal, such as welding processes.

The solute enriched interdendritic flow remelts both primary and secondary arms, and can deflect the primaries. This enables solutal channels to become self-sustaining, forming freckles.

The algorithm is based on a nonlinear temperature evaluation using the average enthalpy which is provided by (i) tabulated phase transformation paths and (ii) tabulated phase properties. The compatibility of this method with tabulations using a thermodynamic database, allows simulating solidification at equilibrium with multiple phase transformations for binary and multicomponent alloys. The method has been validated and applied to three-dimensional cases with macrosegregation: a binary Sn–3 wt.\% Pb alloy and a ternary Fe–2 wt.\% C–30 wt.\% Cr alloy. For the latter case, predictions include composition maps for C and Cr due to thermosolutal instability leading to freckle formation and the subsequent distributions of liquid, {BCC}, {FCC}, M7C3 and Cementite phases. Compared with a previously published enthalpy method, the temperature-based energy solver shows similar accuracy and faster computational time.},

	abstract = {Mathematical expressions of segregation rates occurring during solidification with spongy deformation of an alloyed mushy zone are derived from classical mass balance analyses. The boundaries of the domain considered for the mass balances deform with the same velocity as the solid phase: the reference frame is attached to the solid phase. The three variables needed to fully describe segregation within this “Lagrangian” approach are the mass of solid in the domain, the volume of the domain and the relative velocity of the liquid with respect to the solid. The main result is a mathematical expression for the local macrosegregation rate. The analysis is further extended to produce an expression for the local microsegregation rate that can be compared with the one proposed by Flemings and Nereo (Trans. {AIME} 239 (1967) 1449–1461). An additional term thus enters into our expression. This term is proportional to the local strain rate multiplied by the ratio of the volume fraction of solid over the volume fraction of liquid. It is expected to become dominant when the mushy zone is fully developed (large value of the ratio) and when the strain can be transmitted through a coherent solid skeleton that deforms like a sponge. Still, the origin of the deformation remains arbitrary and the derived expressions could be used to quantify segregation due to the thermal contraction of the solid and liquid phases, the shrinkage associated with the phase transformations, and/or the mechanical deformation of the domain. Finally, the expression for the local microsegregation rate is combined with the first law of thermodynamics. The rate of progress of solidification is thus related to the rate of heat extraction, the transport of heat due to the relative liquid flow with respect to the solid, and the enthalpy of dissolution of the solid in the liquid.},

Overall macrosegregation patterns predicted using Scheil and lever-rule type microsegregation models are found to be similar, although the predicted eutectic fraction is significantly higher with the Scheil-type model. The choice of mushy zone permeability function significantly affects the predicted number, length and orientation of segregated channels. The inclusion of shrinkage-driven flow leads to the prediction of the well-known inverse macrosegregation pattern. However, macrosegregation caused by thermosolutal convection readily masks the inverse segregation. The microsegregation models predict different solid concentrations and eutectic fractions, leading to different solid density distributions which, in turn, cause differences in the extent of contraction-driven flow.},

	abstract = {A fast numerical model has been developed for the quantitative prediction of microsegregation during solidification of ternary alloys. Considering a small volume of uniform temperature, the back-diffusion equations in the primary solid phase are solved in a 1-dimensional configuration using an implicit finite difference formulation with a Landau transformation onto a fixed [0,1] interval. The other phases which may precipitate during solidification are supposed to be stoichiometric and at equilibrium while the liquid is in a state of complete mixing. These calculations are coupled with phase diagram data through the use of mapping files: the liquidus surface, the monovariant lines and all the pertaining information are mapped through calls to Thermo-Calc [B. Sundman, B. Jansson and J. O. Andersson, {CALPHAD}, 9, 153 (1985)], prior to starting the microsegregation calculation itself. This very efficient microsegregation model can thus be coupled directly to macrosegregation computations performed at the scale of a whole casting: from the average enthalpy and concentrations variations computed at each mesh point of a casting during one time step, this microsegregation model is capable of predicting the variations of temperature, of the volume fractions of the various phases, of the liquid concentrations and of the average density. The efficiency of this coupling between microsegregation calculation and thermodynamic mapping files is demonstrated in the particular case of the Al–Mg–Si system.},

These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

La macroségrégation est une hétérogénéité de la concentration en éléments d'alliages à l'échelle du lingot. Ces changements de concentration affectent de manière importante les propriétés mécaniques et chimiques du matériau. Il est donc essentiel de pouvoir prédire ces hétérogénéités pour assurer la qualité des lingots. Après avoir décrit le contexte tant industriel que bibliographique de ce travail, nous préciserons les différents modèles implémentés dans le code de calcul {THERCAST}, un logiciel de solidification développé au {CEMEF}. La description des équations macroscopiques employées sera précédée d'une discussion sur la manière de valider la modélisation de la macroségrégation. Nous aborderons ensuite la théorie du remaillage adaptatif et nous décrirons les éléments essentiels de la stratégie de remaillage développée dans le cadre de cette thèse. Ces modèles seront appliqués à la simulation de la solidification de plusieurs lingots. La validation se fera sur un lingot de petite taille par comparaison avec des résultats expérimentaux et des simulations avec d'autres logiciels. Ensuite nous analyserons en détail les prédictions de {THERCAST} sur un lingot plan, un lingot 3D similaire à un lingot industriel et finalement un lingot plus petit qui nous permettra une étude numérique plus complète. Les limitations de notre modélisation et les phénomènes qu'elle a permis de mettre en évidence seront enfin discutés et permettront de définir quelques orientations intéressantes pour poursuivre cette étude de la macroségrégation.},

This paper provides an analysis of the flow in the neighbourhood of the cusp, via an idealized problem which is solved completely: the cylinders are represented by a vortex dipole and the solution is obtained by complex variable techniques. Surface tension effects are included, but gravity is neglected. The solution is analytic for finite capillary number \&Cscr;, but the radius of curvature on the line of symmetry on the free surface is proportional to exp (−32π\&Cscr;) and is extremely small for \&Cscr; \&gsim; 0.25, implying (in a real fluid) the formation of a cusp. The equation of the free surface is cubic in (x, y) with coefficients depending on \&Cscr;, and with a cusp singularity when \&Cscr; = ∞.The influence of gravity is considered through a stability analysis of the free surface subjected to converging uniform strain, and a necessary condition for the development of a finite-amplitude disturbance of the free surface is obtained.An experiment was carried out using the counter-rotating cylinders as described above, over a range of capillary numbers from zero to 60; the resulting photographs of a cross-section of the free surface are shown in figure 13. For Ω Ωc, the downward-pointing cusp forms, and its structure shows good agreement with the foregoing theory.},

Heat transfer in the mold and insulation materials, as well as the formation of a shrinkage cavity at the top, is taken into account. The numerical results show the evolution of the temperature, melt velocity, and species concentration fields during solidification. The predicted variation of the macrosegregation of carbon and sulfur along the vertical centerline is compared with measurements from an industrial steel ingot that was sectioned and analyzed. Although generally good agreement is obtained, the neglect of sedimentation of free equiaxed grains prevents the prediction of the zone of negative macrosegregation observed in the lower part of the ingot. It is also shown that the inclusion of the shrinkage cavity at the top and the variation of the final solidification temperature due to macrosegregation is important in obtaining good agreement between the predictions and measurements.},

In 30NH4Cl-H2O, freckles are caused by upward flowing liquid jets in the mushy zone. The jets erode the mushy zone causing localized segregation and start new grains by producing dendritic debris. It is shown that the jets observed in 30NH4C1-H2O are free convection resulting from a density inversion in the mushy zone. A comparison of driving force, thermal transport effects and solute transport effects in 30NH4C1-H2O and metallic systems shows that jets are possible in metallic alloys where light elements segregate normally or heavy elements segregate inversely. It is concluded that freckles in unidirectionally solidified castings and vacuum consumable-electrode ingots are caused by convective jets. It is shown that the tendency to freckle is greatest in alloys with a large density inversion, high thermal diffusivity, low solute diffusivity, and low viscosity. For a given alloy, the driving force for freckling is proportional to the inverse square of the thermal gradient. Erosion by the jets is decreased by increasing the thermal gradient and growth rate. The location of freckles is influenced by mushy zone curvature.},

At grain boundaries such openness is even more pronounced, leaving higher-order branches highly exposed to the incoming solute-rich liquid stream.

Further solute advection and local solute rejection due to the local growth causes solute pile-up at the roots of the branches.

While the {FE} method solves the macroscopic conservation equations for heat and mass transfers, the {CA} method is used at a mesoscopic scale to simulate the growth of a mushy zone domain. The limit between this mushy zone domain and the undercooled liquid melt in which it develops defines the envelope of a single grain. A verification is first performed to check that the {CAFE} model retrieves the solution of a purely {FE} simulation for a vanishing undercooling of the growth front. Since the present 2D {CAFE} model is relevant with respect to the solidification experiment developed by Yin and Koster [H. Yin, J. N. Koster, J. Crystal Growth 205 (1999) 590; H. Yin, J. N. Koster, J. Alloy Compd. 352 (2003) 197], comparison is then performed. In particular, the position of the growth front is considered as a time sequence. The effect of the growth undercooling is clearly revealed. The kinetics of the growth front used in the model assumes the development of a rough interfacial dendrite-like morphology. This assumption is discussed considering the value of the normalized entropy of fusion of gallium.},

	abstract = {Although a significant amount of work has already been devoted to the prediction of macrosegregation in steel ingots, most models considered the solid phase as fixed. As a result, it was not possible to correctly predict the macrosegregation in the center of the product. It is generally suspected that the motion of the equiaxed grains is responsible for this macrosegregation. A multiphase and multiscale model that describes the evolution of the morphology of the equiaxed crystals and their motion is presented. The model was used to simulate the solidification of a 3.3-ton steel ingot. Computations that take into account the motion of dendritic and globular grains and computations with a fixed solid phase were performed, and the solidification and macrosegregation formation due to the grain motion and flow of interdendritic liquid were analyzed. The predicted macrosegregation patterns are compared to the experimental results. Most important, it is demonstrated that it is essential to consider the grain morphology, in order to properly model the influence of grain motion on macrosegregation. Further, due to increased computing power, the presented computations could be performed using finer computational grids than was possible in previous studies; this made possible the prediction of mesosegregations, notably A segregates.},

	title = {Peritectic solidification of Cu-Sn alloys: microstructure competition at low speed},
	abstract = {Many commercially important alloys such as Fe-C, Fe-Ni, Cu-Zn, Cu-Sn and Ti-Al exhibit peritectic transitions on solidification. In the two-solid phase region of peritectic metallic systems, a wide spectrum of microstructures has been revealed during directional solidification experiments at low growth rates, where both α- and β-phases would grow independently as planar fronts [1, 2, 12–20]: discrete bands, islands, simultaneous growth of the α- and β-phases in the form of oriented lamellae or fibers and continuous oscillatory tree-like microstructures in highly convective peritectic systems [3, 21, 22]. Recently, Vandyoussefi et al. [27] and Dobler et al. [16] have done extensive solidification experiments on Fe-Ni alloys in the corresponding two-solid phase region. Depending on the growth conditions and local composition, a lamellar eutectic-like structure was observed. Despite recent works, the peritectic solidification at low growth rate is not fully understood. Additionally, coupled growth was observed only for peritectic systems for which the solidification interval of the primary phase ΔΤ 0α is fairly small and with negligible convection; but is it also possible for peritectic alloys with fairly large ΔΤ 0α such as Cu-Sn? If so, what would be the effect of convection? And finally, is the coupled growth front really isothermal? In the present contribution, the peritectic Cu-Sn system has been chosen because of its remarkable properties and technological importance. Indeed, two essential features distinguish Cu-Sn alloys from other peritectic systems: The equilibrium solidification interval of the a-phase decreases with the tin concentration in the hypoperitectic composition range. Additionally, the equilibrium solidification interval of the primary phase is about 25 times larger in the Cu-Sn system than in the Fe-Ni peritectic system. Since only few studies have been made on the detailed solidification of tin bronze alloys, the first goal of this study was to carry out thermal analyses in order to investigate precisely the solidification of Cu-Sn alloys and to measure temperatures of solid-state phase transformations. Therefore, an {SPTA} assembly has been built and successfully calibrated. Additionally, a heat flow model was developed in this work and coupled with a Cu-Sn thermodynamic database to treat solidification-dependent latent heat. Single pan thermal analyses on three Cu-Sn alloy compositions revealed that the corresponding phase diagram recently re-investigated in Liu et al. review [28] is the most reliable. Directional solidification experiments on Cu-Sn alloys of various compositions have been conducted at different velocities in a high gradient Bridgman furnace. In this context, the set-up already used by Dobler [14] has been modified in order to reduce the size of the samples and, accordingly, natural convection and the associated macrosegregation. During each solidification run, two different geometries were thus tested (3 mm diameter cylinder and 4/6 mm tube), allowing the observation of convection effects on solidifying microstructures. An essential outcome of this project is that α+β lamellar structures have been observed in both sample geometries, even when Vp is above the critical velocity for the α planar front growth, i.e., the α-phase grew with a cellular morphology. With the Cu-Sn phase diagram used in the present work and for positions close to the quenched interface, concentration profiles measured across the lamellar structures revealed that the corresponding operating temperature Τ*(x) seems to be non-isothermal, in contradiction with previous experimental observations in Fe-Ni peritectic alloys [14–16]. But, since the Cu-Sn phase diagram is not assessed accurately, Τ*(x) is still subject to large variations (±10°C). On the other hand, the peritectic transformation after solidification has been evidenced and modifies the compositions and fractions of phases. Additionally, local concentration showed that a partial banding mechanism and an unstable lateral propagation of both solid phases were responsible for the formation of lamellar structures. Various geometrical arrangements were revealed on transverse cuts of lamellar structures: straight α- and β-lamellae, labyrinth-like microstructures, disordered arrays of rods of one phase in the matrix of the other phase and uniform regions of β-phase. The dynamic evolution of lamellar structures was attributed to growth competition mechanisms and instabilities between phases originated from the same nuclei. Finally, it should be noted that the Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship was observed between the primary and the peritectic phases on both the straight lamellae and labyrinth-like microstructure. Finally, all lamellar structures ended by the termination of α-lamellae and the subsequent growth of a β planar front. In this context, the α-lamellae of lamellar structures observed in the 4/6 mm tube exhibited in all cases a "hammer-like" morphology before being overgrown by the peritectic phase. Careful investigations of this morphology revealed that it resulted effectively from growth competition mechanisms, which remain to be fully understood. In a simulated geometry corresponding to the 4/6 mm tube of Cu-Sn samples, 3D macrosegregation modeling revealed that a nearly helical convection pattern existed in the liquid phase ahead of a moving planar α-liquid interface. And between each plume, the fluid flow was mostly oriented parallel to the solid-liquid interface. As a consequence, the lateral propagation of the α- and β-phases during the 3D growth competition was surely affected by these convective motions. Finally, natural convection and the associated solute enrichment were assumed to be responsible for the destabilization of lamellar structures and the subsequent end of α-lamellae. The multi-phase field computations emphasized that the stability of the triple junction between α-, β- and liquid phases is function of the initial alloy concentration C0, of the lamellar spacing λ and of the thermal gradient Gl. In a near future, directional solidification experiments are planned to be conducted onboard of the International Space Station. Then, the obtained peritectic microstructures will have to be compared with the microstructures observed in the present work in order to assess more precisely the effect of natural convection on the formation of lamellar structures.},

The energy and level-set equation are discretized using finite-volume and finite-difference method, respectively. Feed-path is computed by tracking mass-less particles along the liquid–solid interface during solidification using combined Eulerian–Lagrangian framework. The proposed model is benchmarked on six test cases, where temperature contours and solidification time are compared with a finite-element-method based commercial software. The capability to predict the temporal evolution of interface and to identify multiple hot-spots is validated with an industrial aluminum-alloy lug casting.

	abstract = {A Rayleigh number based criterion is developed for predicting the formation of freckles in Ni-base superalloy castings. This criterion relies on finding the maximum local Rayleigh number in the mush, where the ratio of the driving buoyancy force to the retarding frictional force is the largest. A critical Rayleigh number for freckle formation of approximately 0.25 is found from available experimental data on directional solidification of a Ni-base superalloy. If the Rayleigh number in a superalloy casting is below this critical value, freckles are not expected to form. Full numerical simulations of freckling in directional solidification of superalloys are conducted for a large variety of casting conditions, alloy compositions, and inclinations of the system with respect to gravity. For the vertical cases, the Rayleigh numbers at the starting points of the predicted freckles are in good agreement with the critical value established from the experiments. The simulations confirm that the same critical Rayleigh number applies to different superalloys. The simulations for inclined domains show that even a small amount of inclination (less than 10 deg) significantly lowers the critical Rayleigh number and moves the freckles to the side wall of the casting, where the mushy zone has advanced the most relative to gravity. In application of the Rayleigh number criterion to complex-shaped superalloy castings, the absence of freckles near upper and lower boundaries and in sections of insufficient cross-sectional area or height needs to be taken into account as well. The criterion can be used to study the tradeoffs between different superalloy compositions, applied temperature gradients, and casting speeds. Additional experiments, in particular for other superalloys and for a range of inclinations, are desirable to confirm the critical Rayleigh numbers found in the present study.},

The three permeability laws have similar permeability in the inner part of the mushy zone (low liquid fraction regions), however, in the outer part of the mushy zone (high liquid fraction regions) permeability differs significantly. Simulations are performed for the solidification of a Sn–Pb alloy in a two-dimensional rectangular cavity using the three permeability laws and the effects of differences in these laws in the outer part of the mushy zone on macro- and meso-segregation are studied. We notice a sensitivity of the predicted macro- and meso-segregation, and of the width and shape of the mushy zone to various permeability laws. The sensitivity of the prediction of mesosegregates is much stronger than that of macrosegregation predictions. The value of the microstructural parameter used in the permeability laws plays an important role on the intensity of the macrosegregation and the nature of channel segregates with regard to their number, length and orientation. It has been observed that the permeability in the outer part of the mushy zone plays a key role in the formation of channel segregates.},

To restrict the interface from moving while re-distancing, an improved re-distancing scheme proposed in the finite difference context [J. Comput. Phys. 148 (1999) 81–124] is adapted for finite element discretization. This enables us to accurately compute the flows with large density and viscosity differences, as well as surface tension.

The development of the chimneys and the probability of their surviving depend sensitively on the spatial and temporal properties of the flow field. Variations of the vertical temperature gradient along the solidification cell lead to the observation of different mechanisms for chimney formation. Perturbations of the dendritic structure are the origin of development of segregation freckles in case of low temperature gradients. The long-term stabilities of these segregation channels are strongly influenced by the transient nature of the melt convection. The situation at higher temperature gradients is characterized by two dominating convection rolls in the liquid phase which are driven by a lateral temperature gradient and the convex shape of the solidification front. The penetration of this flow pattern into the mushy zone results in continuous accumulation of solute in the central part of the mushy zone followed by a remelting of the solid fraction and the occurrence of a stable chimney.},

	abstract = {A model combining the partial‑equilibrium and para‑equilibrium thermodynamic approximations is presented. It accounts for fast diffusion of interstitial elements, such as carbon, and low diffusion of substitutional elements in the solid phases, while complete mixing is assumed for all elements in the liquid phase. These considerations are turned into classical mathematical expressions for the chemical potentials and the u‑fractions, to which mass conservation equations are added. The combination of the two models permits application to steels, dealing with partial‑equilibrium for solidification and para‑equilibrium for both the δ‑{BCC} to γ‑{FCC} peritectic transformation and the γ‑{FCC} to α‑{BCC} solid state transformation. The numerical scheme makes use of calls to Thermo‑Calc and the {TQ}‑interface for calculating thermodynamic equilibrium and accessing data from the {TCFE}6 database. Applications are given for a commercial steel. The results are discussed based on comparison with classical microsegregation models and experimental data.},

These defects have been observed in nickel base superalloys in both directionally solidified polycrystalline and single crystal ingots. Such ingots exhibit a relatively periodic distribution of vertical freckle trails around their circumference which are particularly suitable for study. This paper investigates the nature of “Freckles,” examines the conditions under which they occur and specifies a set of consistent observations which any successful model for freckling must explain. Visual, chemical, electron probe, metallographic, and X-ray diffraction data are presented which establish the appearance, composition and orientation differences between freckled and normal regions in single crystals of the nickel base superalloys Udimet 700 and Mar-M200. It is shown that the freckle lines are linear assemblies of small random equiaxed grains which are enriched in all but the inversely segregated solute species. Excessive interdendritic porosity and feeding shrinkage are observed in the vicinity of a freckle line. Some correlations of the tendency toward freckling and the geometric distribution of freckle lines are made with growth rate, thermal gradient, and interface shape. The dependence of freckling tendency on composition is examined in the Ni-Al system.},

	abstract = {“Macrosegregation” represents a class of defects in cast products of serious concern to both alloy producers and users. Many types of macrosegregation result from thermosolutal convection in the solid plus liquid and all-liquid regions of a solidifying alloy, and this has spurred modeling and simulations, which treat the solid plus liquid region (i.e., the mushy zone) as a porous medium of variable porosity and permeability. Simulations include scenarios in which the convection is strong enough to make channels in the mushy zone region, and these channels lead to localized segregates known as “freckles”. Using Pb-10 wt.\% Sn as a model alloy, we simulated vertical solidification with various solidification rates. By sufficiently increasing the cooling rate at the bottom surface, convection can be suppressed enough to prevent the formation of freckles. The simulation is an example of relating microstructural metrics to a macroscopic property of the porous medium used in continuum theory. In this case, the property is the permeability, which is governed by two microstructural metrics: the volume fraction of liquid and a characteristic length in the dendritic microstructure. Permeability data, relevant to columnar dendritic solidification, are reviewed, and recommendations for future work on determining the permeability in terms of microstructural metrics are given.},

	isbn = {9780849382383},
	abstract = {Solidification is one of the oldest processes known for producing complex shapes for applications ranging from art to industry, and today it still remains one of the most important commercial technologies for many materials. Since the 1980s, numerous fundamental developments in the understanding of solidification processes and microstructure formation have been derived from both analytical theories and the application of computational techniques using commonly available powerful computers. This book integrates these developments in a comprehensive volume that also presents and places them in the context of more classical theories. Divided into three sections, the text evolves from fundamentals to applications, giving professional engineers and students a firm understanding that they can readily apply.  The first part, Fundamentals and Macroscale Phenomena, presents the thermodynamics of solutions and then builds on that subject to motivate and describe equilibrium phase diagrams. Transport phenomena are discussed next, focusing on the issues of most importance to liquid-solid phase transformations, then moving on to describe in detail both analytical and numerical approaches to solving such problems.  The second part, Microstructure, employs these fundamental concepts for the treatment of nucleation, dendritic growth, microsegregation, eutectic and peritectic solidication, and microstructure competition. This part concludes with a chapter describing the coupling of macro- and microscopic phenomena in microstructure development.  Defects, the third and final section describes various types of defects that may occur — with emphasis on porosity, hot tearing, and macrosegregation — presented using the modeling tools and microstructure descriptions developed earlier in the text.

The present method offers distinct advantages of simplicity and flexibility in incorporation of micro-scale models, as demonstrated by the use of a back diffusion parameter in the microsegregation model. Results from the present method are compared with those in the literature using a fully implicit method, and they show significant improvement in final macrosegregation prediction.},

In order to predict the inverse segregation at the cooled surface accurately, the contribution of the boundary integral is retained in the weak formulation of the solute conservation equation. This procedure eliminates the false flux, which incorrectly causes a negative segregation at the cooled surface. In the case of vertical solidification under gravity, when channels form, the shrinkage turns the flow inside the channel downwards and towards the solidifying eutectic. Without including shrinkage, the flow in an entire channel is upwards.},

	abstract = {A numerical implementation of a three-dimensional (3D) cellular automaton ({CA})?finite element ({FE}) model has been developed for the prediction of solidification grain structures. For the first time, it relies on optimized parallel computation to solve industrial-scale problems (centimeter to meter long) while using a sufficiently small {CA} grid size to predict representative structures. Several algorithm modifications and strategies to maximize parallel efficiency are introduced. Improvements on a real case simulation are measured and discussed. The {CA}?{FE} implementation here is demonstrated using 32 computing units to predict grain structure in a 2.08?m???0.382?m???0.382?m ingot involving 4.9 billion cells and 1.6 million grains. These numerical improvements permit tracking of local changes in texture and grain size over real-cast parts while integrating interactions with macrosegregation, heat flow and fluid flow. Full 3D is essential in all these analyses, and can be dealt with successfully using the implementation presented here.},

	abstract = {A quasi-two-dimensional solidification benchmark experiment with controlled thermal boundary conditions is proposed. The experiment consists in solidifying a rectangular ingot of Sn–3 wt.\%Pb alloy using two lateral heat exchangers to extract the heat flux from one or two sides of the sample. The temperature difference between the two sides of the heat exchangers may vary from 0 to 40 K and the cooling rate from 0.02 to 0.04 K/s. This slow-cooling condition has been used to promote segregation formation. An array of fifty thermocouples placed on the corresponding sample walls is used to determine the instantaneous temperature distribution. During the solidification process, the temperature field is recorded versus time and analyzed. This makes it possible to estimate the change in temperature due to natural convection, the velocity field and the solidification macrostructure and segregation behavior. After each experiment, the segregation patterns are obtained by X-ray analysis and confirmed by eutectic fraction measurements. The local solute distribution is determined by means of induction coupled plasma analysis.},

The model simulates the entire solidification process starting with the initial melt to the solidified cast, and the resulting segregation is predicted. Emphasis is given to the initial transient, when the dendritic zone begins to develop and the conditions for the possible nucleation of channels are established. The mechanisms that lead to the creation and eventual growth or termination of channels are explained in detail and illustrated by several numerical examples. Predictions of the pattern and location of channels in different cooling situations are in good agreement with experimental observations.},

	abstract = {In this paper, mass and momentum conservation equations are derived for the flow of interdendritic liquid during solidification using the volume-averaging approach. In this approach, the mushy zone is conceived to be two interpenetrating phases; each phase is described with the usual field quantities, which are continuous in that phase but discontinuous over the entire space. On the microscopic scale, the usual conservation equations along with the appropriate interfacial boundary conditions describe the state of the system. However, the solution to these equations in the microscopic scale is not practical because of the complex interfacial geometry in the mushy zone. Instead, the scale at which the system is described is altered by averaging the microscopic equations over some representative elementary volume within the mushy zone, resulting in macroscopic equations that can be used to solve practical problems. For a fraction of liquid equal to unity, the equations reduce to the usual conservation equations for a single-phase liquid. It is also found that the resistance offered by the solid to the flow of interdendritic liquid in the mushy zone is best described by two coefficients, namely, the inverse of permeability and a second-order resistance coefficient. For the flow in columnar dendritic structures, the second-order coefficient along with the permeability should be evaluated experimentally. For the flow in equiaxial dendritic structures(i.e., isotropic media), the inverse of permeability alone is sufficient to quantify the resistance offered by the solid.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the application of the two-phase solidification model with a splitting scheme for coupling macroscopic transport and grain growth, described in part I of this work, is presented with simulations of solidification of a binary alloy in a rectangular cavity. The splitting method is first verified by comparing the predictions with a classical directly coupled method. The verification is performed for a critical limiting case, as identified in part I, with infinitely fast microscopic diffusion (lever rule) and a fixed solid in the mushy zone. A further test is performed to show the capability of our model, where macroscopic transport and diffusion-controlled grain growth kinetics are coupled by the splitting scheme, in predicting recalescence. Thereafter, the complete model, as presented in part I, is applied to simulate solidification in its full complexity, considering the grain motion and grain growth kinetics. With the help of the model predictions the influence of the motion of globular solid grains on the transport phenomena during solidification and formation of macrosegregation is discussed.},
