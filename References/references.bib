	abstract = {A one-dimensional solidification model has been developed to study the directional solidification of dendritic alloys. It is based on the resolution of the heat flow equation using a two-interface front tracking technique. The two interfaces are defined by imaginary limits, assumed to be macroscopically flat, which correspond to the positions of the growing dendritic and eutectic interfaces. These delimit the three regions that are considered: liquid, mushy zone and solid. Growth kinetics laws are applied to the interfaces by velocity vs temperature relationships. It was found that, if complete solidification was carried out directionally up to the top of the ingot (i.e. formation of a fully columnar structure), then the velocity of the dendrite tips first increased during the stage of the superheat loss, then decreased when no substantial thermal gradient remained in the liquid ahead of the growing dendritic interface. Applied to directional solidification experiments carried out with aluminium–silicon alloys, the model shows that this maximum velocity was reached when the top position of the mushy zone (i.e. the dendritic interface) reached about two-thirds the length of the ingots. This position being in the vicinity of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition ({CET}) observed in the longitudinal section of the ingots, a {CET} scenario is proposed based on a constrained-to-unconstrained growth transition, leading to breakdown of the columnar dendritic front.},

	abstract = {A multiphase/multiscale model is used to predict the columnar-to-equiaxed transition ({CET}) during solidification of binary alloys. The model consists of averaged energy and species conservation equations, coupled with nucleation and growth laws for dendritic structures. A new mechanism for the {CET} is proposed based on solutal interactions between the equiaxed grains and the advancing columnar front—as opposed to the commonly used mechanical blocking criterion. The resulting differences in the {CET} prediction are demonstrated for cases where a steady state can be assumed, and a revised isotherm velocity (V T ) vs temperature gradient (G) map for the {CET} is presented. The model is validated by predicting the {CET} in previously performed unsteady, unidirectional solidification experiments involving Al-Si alloys of three different compositions. Good agreement is obtained between measured and predicted cooling curves. A parametric study is performed to investigate the dependence of the {CET} position on the nucleation undercooling and the density of nuclei in the equiaxed zone. Nucleation undercoolings are determined that provide the best agreement between measured and calculated {CET} positions. It is found that for all three alloy compositions, the nucleation undercoolings are very close to the maximum columnar dendrite tip undercoolings, indicating that the origin of the equiaxed grains may not be heterogeneous nucleation, but rather a breakdown or fragmentation of the columnar dendrites.},

In situ characterization of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition in a refined Al–3.5 wt.\% Ni alloy is achieved by synchrotron X-ray radiography. Two main characteristics are derived from the radiographs for each nucleated grain, namely the nucleation position in the sample and the orientation of the main trunk relative to the vertical temperature gradient. These data are then used as input for the {CA}-{FE} simulations. The {CA}-{FE} model takes into account the effects of macroscopic transport of heat, liquid momentum and solute mass on the development of the dendritic grain structure and vice versa. The influence of convection on macroscopic shape of the growth front, the grain structure, the microstructure distribution and macro-segregation is determined by a comparison between the experimental observations and results from the numerical simulations with and without fluid flow. Good qualitative agreement is obtained and limitations that are linked to the two-dimensional approximation and the need for direct tracking of the eutectic grain structure are pointed out.},

	abstract = {A Rayleigh number based criterion is developed for predicting the formation of freckles in Ni-base superalloy castings. This criterion relies on finding the maximum local Rayleigh number in the mush, where the ratio of the driving buoyancy force to the retarding frictional force is the largest. A critical Rayleigh number for freckle formation of approximately 0.25 is found from available experimental data on directional solidification of a Ni-base superalloy. If the Rayleigh number in a superalloy casting is below this critical value, freckles are not expected to form. Full numerical simulations of freckling in directional solidification of superalloys are conducted for a large variety of casting conditions, alloy compositions, and inclinations of the system with respect to gravity. For the vertical cases, the Rayleigh numbers at the starting points of the predicted freckles are in good agreement with the critical value established from the experiments. The simulations confirm that the same critical Rayleigh number applies to different superalloys. The simulations for inclined domains show that even a small amount of inclination (less than 10 deg) significantly lowers the critical Rayleigh number and moves the freckles to the side wall of the casting, where the mushy zone has advanced the most relative to gravity. In application of the Rayleigh number criterion to complex-shaped superalloy castings, the absence of freckles near upper and lower boundaries and in sections of insufficient cross-sectional area or height needs to be taken into account as well. The criterion can be used to study the tradeoffs between different superalloy compositions, applied temperature gradients, and casting speeds. Additional experiments, in particular for other superalloys and for a range of inclinations, are desirable to confirm the critical Rayleigh numbers found in the present study.},

prime, this class of alloys has increased susceptibility for the 
formation of melt segregation defects, such as freckles. The 
propensity for freckle formation is further aggravated by the need 
for larger diameter ingots to support the trend toward higher 
thrust large diameter fan engines used on wide body twin engine 
aircraft. A review and assessment of production quality control 
techniques for freckle inspection are discussed. An in depth 
microstructural, chemical, and structural characterization is

Many types of macrosegregation result from thermosolutal convection in the solid plus liquid and all-liquid regions of a solidifying alloy, and this has spurred modeling and simulations, which treat the solid plus liquid region (i.e., the mushy zone) as a porous medium of variable porosity and permeability. Simulations include scenarios in which the convection is strong enough to make channels in the mushy zone region, and these channels lead to localized segregates known as “freckles”. Using Pb-10 wt.\% Sn as a model alloy, we simulated vertical solidification with various solidification rates. By sufficiently increasing the cooling rate at the bottom surface, convection can be suppressed enough to prevent the formation of freckles. The simulation is an example of relating microstructural metrics to a macroscopic property of the porous medium used in continuum theory. In this case, the property is the permeability, which is governed by two microstructural metrics: the volume fraction of liquid and a characteristic length in the dendritic microstructure. Permeability data, relevant to columnar dendritic solidification, are reviewed, and recommendations for future work on determining the permeability in terms of microstructural metrics are given.},

Of the criteria reported in the literature, those based on the Rayleigh number seem best suited to predict the onset of freckle formation. However, in their current form, these criteria cannot explain why freckles develop predominantly at the surface of single crystal ({SX}) castings and at midradius in {VAR}/{ESR} ingots. An experimental Bridgman-type furnace has been built to directionally solidify freckle-prone superalloys, {CMSX}-11B, {RENÉ}88, {NIM}80A, {WASPALOY}, {MAR}-M247, and a variation of {IN}718 with high silicon content, at various angles to the vertical. Under typical industrial solidification conditions (thermal gradient between 500 and 4000 K m−1 (5{\textless}G{\textless}40 °C cm−1) and solidification rate between 1.67×10−5 and 1.0×10−4 m s−1 (1{\textless}R{\textless}6mm min−1)), the results indicate a dependency of freckling on growth front angle likely related to the anisotropy in permeability. A modified Rayleigh criterion has been developed which accounts for directional permeability and orientation of the growth front relative to the gravity vector. Application to the experimental data shows good correlation with the onset of freckling for the range of solidification conditions examined in the study. The approximate threshold value for the modified Rayleigh number was estimated to be for {CMSX}-11B, 0.88, for {RENÉ}88, 0.90, for {NIM}80A, 0.85, for {WASPALOY}, 0.95, for {MAR}-M247, 0.86, and for {IN}718-Si, 0.65.},

	abstract = {Macrosegregation defect freckles result from the convective flow due to a density gradient in the mushy zone. Several freckle criteria were proposed in the literature for the evaluation of the freckle tendency of alloys and processes. These criteria were examined using experimental data of the upward directional solidification of Pb-Sn, Pb-Sb, and Pb-Sn-Sb systems. It is found that the freckle criterion given by Flemings and co-workers gives the best description of the freckle tendency. A Rayleigh number is derived from Flemings’ criterion. The critical value of the Rayleigh number is found to be Ra cr ≈ 1.},

	abstract = {A criterion for predicting the formation of freckles for Pb-Sn and Ni-base superalloys is evaluated using available experimental data. The criterion is based on a maximum value of the Rayleigh number, which indicates that the magnitude of buoyancy forces is largest with respect to the retarding frictional forces. The definition of the Rayleigh number involves a characteristic length scale. The two options explored in this study are the distance from the liquid mush interface and the scale represented by the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed. Additionally, two alternative ways of computing the mushy-zone permeability are explored. Only two of the possible combinations of length scales and permeability relations provide a maximum value within the mush that can be chosen as a representative value for the given conditions. It is found that the Rayleigh number that uses the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed as a length scale provides the best separation between freckled and nonfreckled data. Critical values for the Rayleigh number are in the range of 38 to 46 for vertically solidified Pb-Sn and within the range of 30 to 33 for Ni-base superalloys. Although not exactly the same, the proximity of these intervals indicates that the critical Rayleigh number is not very sensitive to alloy-specific system parameters. The influence of sample pulling inclination angle on this critical value is assessed for Ni-base superalloys. A preliminary relationship between the critical Rayleigh number and the inclination angle is developed.},

	abstract = {The directional solidification of Ga-25wt pct In alloys within a Hele-Shaw cell under the influence of thermosolutal convection was observed by means of X-ray radioscopy. The unstable density stratification at the solidification front causes the formation of rising plumes containing solute-rich liquids. The development of the chimneys and the probability of their surviving depend sensitively on the spatial and temporal properties of the flow field. Variations of the vertical temperature gradient along the solidification cell lead to the observation of different mechanisms for chimney formation. Perturbations of the dendritic structure are the origin of development of segregation freckles in case of low temperature gradients. The long-term stabilities of these segregation channels are strongly influenced by the transient nature of the melt convection. The situation at higher temperature gradients is characterized by two dominating convection rolls in the liquid phase which are driven by a lateral temperature gradient and the convex shape of the solidification front. The penetration of this flow pattern into the mushy zone results in continuous accumulation of solute in the central part of the mushy zone followed by a remelting of the solid fraction and the occurrence of a stable chimney.},

An open dendritic network is exposed to solute-rich liquid which arrives from the solidification front. At grain boundaries such openness is even more pronounced, leaving higher-order branches highly exposed to the incoming solute-rich liquid stream. It was found that streaming of solute-enriched liquid at the tip of high-order branches promotes growth by local undercooling. Further solute advection and local solute rejection due to the local growth causes solute pile-up at the roots of the branches. This solute pile-up alters the local compositional balance at the solid–liquid interface at the root, causing the root to remelt, which in turn results in further branch detachment.},

	abstract = {A quasi-two-dimensional solidification benchmark experiment with controlled thermal boundary conditions is proposed. The experiment consists in solidifying a rectangular ingot of Sn–3 wt.\%Pb alloy using two lateral heat exchangers to extract the heat flux from one or two sides of the sample. The temperature difference between the two sides of the heat exchangers may vary from 0 to 40 K and the cooling rate from 0.02 to 0.04 K/s. This slow-cooling condition has been used to promote segregation formation. An array of fifty thermocouples placed on the corresponding sample walls is used to determine the instantaneous temperature distribution. During the solidification process, the temperature field is recorded versus time and analyzed. This makes it possible to estimate the change in temperature due to natural convection, the velocity field and the solidification macrostructure and segregation behavior. After each experiment, the segregation patterns are obtained by X-ray analysis and confirmed by eutectic fraction measurements. The local solute distribution is determined by means of induction coupled plasma analysis.},

The macroscopic transport equations for each phase are derived using the technique of volumetric averaging. The basic forms of the constitutive relations are developed. These relations link the macroscopic transport phenomena to microscopic processes such as microstructure development, interfacial stresses, and interfacial heat and mass transfer. Thermodynamic relations are presented, and it is shown that nonequilibrium effects can be addressed within the framework of the present model. Various simplifications of the model are examined, and future modeling needs are discussed.},

	abstract = {La formation de la structure de grains dans les métaux pendant la solidification est déterminante pour les propriétés mécaniques et électroniques des pièces coulées. En plus de la texture donnée au matériau, la germination et la croissance des grains sont liées en particulier avec la formation des phases thermodynamiques et les inhomogénéités en composition d'éléments d'alliage. La structure de grains est rarement modélisée à l'échelle macroscopique, d'autant plus que l'approximation 2D est très souvent injustifiée. Dans ces travaux, la germination et la croissance de chaque grain individuel sont suivies avec un modèle macroscopique 3D {CAFE}. La microstructure interne des grains n'est pas explicitement résolue. Pour valider les approximations faites sur cette microstructure, une comparaison directe avec un modèle microscopique 'champ de phase' a été réalisée. Celle-ci a permis de valider les hypothèses de construction du modèle {CAFE}, de mettre en avant le lien entre données calculées par les modèles microscopiques et paramètres d'entrée des modèles à plus grande échelle, et les domaines de validité de chaque modèle. Dans un deuxième temps, un couplage avec la ségrégation chimique et les bases de données thermodynamiques a été mise en place et appliquée sur un alliage binaire étain-plomb. Une expérience de macroségrégation par convection naturelle a été simulée. L'accord entre les courbes de température expérimentales et simulées atteint une précision de l'ordre de 1K, et la recalescence est correctement prédite. Les cartes de compositions sont comparables qualitativement, ainsi que la structure de grains. Les avantages du suivi de la structure ont été mis en évidence par rapport à une simulation par éléments finis classique. De plus, il a été montré que le calcul 3D était ici indispensable. Enfin, une implémentation parallèle optimisée du code a permis d'appliquer le modèle {CAFE} à un lingot de silicium polycristallin industriel de dimensions 0,192 x 0,192 x 2,08m, avec une taille de cellules de 250µm. Au total, 4,9 milliards de cellules sont représentées sur le domaine, et la germination et la croissance de 1,6 million de grains sont suivies.},
