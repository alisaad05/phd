	isbn = {9780849382383},
	abstract = {Solidification is one of the oldest processes known for producing complex shapes for applications ranging from art to industry, and today it still remains one of the most important commercial technologies for many materials. Since the 1980s, numerous fundamental developments in the understanding of solidification processes and microstructure formation have been derived from both analytical theories and the application of computational techniques using commonly available powerful computers. This book integrates these developments in a comprehensive volume that also presents and places them in the context of more classical theories. Divided into three sections, the text evolves from fundamentals to applications, giving professional engineers and students a firm understanding that they can readily apply.  The first part, Fundamentals and Macroscale Phenomena, presents the thermodynamics of solutions and then builds on that subject to motivate and describe equilibrium phase diagrams. Transport phenomena are discussed next, focusing on the issues of most importance to liquid-solid phase transformations, then moving on to describe in detail both analytical and numerical approaches to solving such problems.  The second part, Microstructure, employs these fundamental concepts for the treatment of nucleation, dendritic growth, microsegregation, eutectic and peritectic solidication, and microstructure competition. This part concludes with a chapter describing the coupling of macro- and microscopic phenomena in microstructure development.  Defects, the third and final section describes various types of defects that may occur — with emphasis on porosity, hot tearing, and macrosegregation — presented using the modeling tools and microstructure descriptions developed earlier in the text.

and Rene 88@ contain relatively high weight percents of 
hardening elements (e.g. Al \& Ti), for a conventionally cast

forged) product. Due to the higher volume fraction of gamma 
prime, this class of alloys has increased susceptibility for the 
formation of melt segregation defects, such as freckles. The 
propensity for freckle formation is further aggravated by the need 
for larger diameter ingots to support the trend toward higher 
thrust large diameter fan engines used on wide body twin engine 
aircraft. A review and assessment of production quality control 
techniques for freckle inspection are discussed. An in depth 
microstructural, chemical, and structural characterization is 
presented. The effects of freckle defects on key mechanical 
properties for the design of critical rotating engine components 
are shown. Finally, a brief discussion of a root cause investigation 
on the origin of freckle formation in this alloy class is given.

The proposed method starts by the use of a finite element variational multiscale ({VMS}) method, which consists in here of a decomposition for both the velocity and the pressure fields into coarse/resolved scales and fine/unresolved scales. This choice of decomposition is shown to be favorable for simulating flows at high Reynolds number. We explore the behaviour and accuracy of the proposed approximation on three test cases. First, the lid-driven square cavity at Reynolds number up to 50,000 is compared with the highly resolved numerical simulations and second, the lid-driven cubic cavity up to Re = 12,000 is compared with the experimental data. Finally, we study the flow over a 2D backward-facing step at Re = 42,000. Results show that the present implementation is able to exhibit good stability and accuracy properties for high Reynolds number flows with unstructured meshes.},

The microscale solidification model resolves the complex interaction of solute partition, interdendritic thermosolutal convection, dendrite formation and remelting. These simulations show that it is competition between all off these phenomena at the microstructural level that determines both the initiation and survival of solute channels and, hence, the propensity for freckle formation. The solute enriched interdendritic flow remelts both primary and secondary arms, and can deflect the primaries. This enables solutal channels to become self-sustaining, forming freckles. The microstructural model was then applied to predict the critical Rayleigh number, with excellent agreement with a large range of experimental data, demonstrating its potential for applications to new alloy systems and solidification processes.},

	abstract = {“Macrosegregation” represents a class of defects in cast products of serious concern to both alloy producers and users. Many types of macrosegregation result from thermosolutal convection in the solid plus liquid and all-liquid regions of a solidifying alloy, and this has spurred modeling and simulations, which treat the solid plus liquid region (i.e., the mushy zone) as a porous medium of variable porosity and permeability. Simulations include scenarios in which the convection is strong enough to make channels in the mushy zone region, and these channels lead to localized segregates known as “freckles”. Using Pb-10 wt.\% Sn as a model alloy, we simulated vertical solidification with various solidification rates. By sufficiently increasing the cooling rate at the bottom surface, convection can be suppressed enough to prevent the formation of freckles. The simulation is an example of relating microstructural metrics to a macroscopic property of the porous medium used in continuum theory. In this case, the property is the permeability, which is governed by two microstructural metrics: the volume fraction of liquid and a characteristic length in the dendritic microstructure. Permeability data, relevant to columnar dendritic solidification, are reviewed, and recommendations for future work on determining the permeability in terms of microstructural metrics are given.},

These defects have been observed in nickel base superalloys in both directionally solidified polycrystalline and single crystal ingots. Such ingots exhibit a relatively periodic distribution of vertical freckle trails around their circumference which are particularly suitable for study. This paper investigates the nature of “Freckles,” examines the conditions under which they occur and specifies a set of consistent observations which any successful model for freckling must explain. Visual, chemical, electron probe, metallographic, and X-ray diffraction data are presented which establish the appearance, composition and orientation differences between freckled and normal regions in single crystals of the nickel base superalloys Udimet 700 and Mar-M200. It is shown that the freckle lines are linear assemblies of small random equiaxed grains which are enriched in all but the inversely segregated solute species. Excessive interdendritic porosity and feeding shrinkage are observed in the vicinity of a freckle line. Some correlations of the tendency toward freckling and the geometric distribution of freckle lines are made with growth rate, thermal gradient, and interface shape. The dependence of freckling tendency on composition is examined in the Ni-Al system.},

Simulation results are presented for a variety of casting speeds and imposed thermal gradients and for two alloy compositions. It is found that for a given alloy composition, the onset of convection and freckle formation occurs at a critical primary dendrite arm spacing, which agrees well with previous experimental findings. The predicted number and shape of the freckle chains in the unstable cases also agree qualitatively with experimental observations.

	abstract = {The evaluation of a numerical criterion to provide quantitative insight on freckling conditions is critical to the successful manufacture of large superalloy castings. Of the criteria reported in the literature, those based on the Rayleigh number seem best suited to predict the onset of freckle formation. However, in their current form, these criteria cannot explain why freckles develop predominantly at the surface of single crystal ({SX}) castings and at midradius in {VAR}/{ESR} ingots. An experimental Bridgman-type furnace has been built to directionally solidify freckle-prone superalloys, {CMSX}-11B, {RENÉ}88, {NIM}80A, {WASPALOY}, {MAR}-M247, and a variation of {IN}718 with high silicon content, at various angles to the vertical. Under typical industrial solidification conditions (thermal gradient between 500 and 4000 K m−1 (5{\textless}G{\textless}40 °C cm−1) and solidification rate between 1.67×10−5 and 1.0×10−4 m s−1 (1{\textless}R{\textless}6mm min−1)), the results indicate a dependency of freckling on growth front angle likely related to the anisotropy in permeability. A modified Rayleigh criterion has been developed which accounts for directional permeability and orientation of the growth front relative to the gravity vector. Application to the experimental data shows good correlation with the onset of freckling for the range of solidification conditions examined in the study. The approximate threshold value for the modified Rayleigh number was estimated to be for {CMSX}-11B, 0.88, for {RENÉ}88, 0.90, for {NIM}80A, 0.85, for {WASPALOY}, 0.95, for {MAR}-M247, 0.86, and for {IN}718-Si, 0.65.},

The criterion is based on a maximum value of the Rayleigh number, which indicates that the magnitude of buoyancy forces is largest with respect to the retarding frictional forces. The definition of the Rayleigh number involves a characteristic length scale. The two options explored in this study are the distance from the liquid mush interface and the scale represented by the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed. Additionally, two alternative ways of computing the mushy-zone permeability are explored. Only two of the possible combinations of length scales and permeability relations provide a maximum value within the mush that can be chosen as a representative value for the given conditions. It is found that the Rayleigh number that uses the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed as a length scale provides the best separation between freckled and nonfreckled data. Critical values for the Rayleigh number are in the range of 38 to 46 for vertically solidified Pb-Sn and within the range of 30 to 33 for Ni-base superalloys. Although not exactly the same, the proximity of these intervals indicates that the critical Rayleigh number is not very sensitive to alloy-specific system parameters. The influence of sample pulling inclination angle on this critical value is assessed for Ni-base superalloys. A preliminary relationship between the critical Rayleigh number and the inclination angle is developed.},

While the {FE} method solves the macroscopic conservation equations for heat and mass transfers, the {CA} method is used at a mesoscopic scale to simulate the growth of a mushy zone domain. The limit between this mushy zone domain and the undercooled liquid melt in which it develops defines the envelope of a single grain. A verification is first performed to check that the {CAFE} model retrieves the solution of a purely {FE} simulation for a vanishing undercooling of the growth front. Since the present 2D {CAFE} model is relevant with respect to the solidification experiment developed by Yin and Koster [H. Yin, J. N. Koster, J. Crystal Growth 205 (1999) 590; H. Yin, J. N. Koster, J. Alloy Compd. 352 (2003) 197], comparison is then performed. In particular, the position of the growth front is considered as a time sequence. The effect of the growth undercooling is clearly revealed. The kinetics of the growth front used in the model assumes the development of a rough interfacial dendrite-like morphology. This assumption is discussed considering the value of the normalized entropy of fusion of gallium.},

The unstable density stratification at the solidification front causes the formation of rising plumes containing solute-rich liquids. The development of the chimneys and the probability of their surviving depend sensitively on the spatial and temporal properties of the flow field. Variations of the vertical temperature gradient along the solidification cell lead to the observation of different mechanisms for chimney formation. Perturbations of the dendritic structure are the origin of development of segregation freckles in case of low temperature gradients. The long-term stabilities of these segregation channels are strongly influenced by the transient nature of the melt convection. The situation at higher temperature gradients is characterized by two dominating convection rolls in the liquid phase which are driven by a lateral temperature gradient and the convex shape of the solidification front. The penetration of this flow pattern into the mushy zone results in continuous accumulation of solute in the central part of the mushy zone followed by a remelting of the solid fraction and the occurrence of a stable chimney.},

	abstract = {High-brilliance synchrotron X-radiation microscopy and further image processing allowed in situ observations of local solute-enrichment during fragmentation of dendrite arms under normal non-forced-convection conditions during directional solidification of an Al–20 wt.\% Cu alloy. An open dendritic network is exposed to solute-rich liquid which arrives from the solidification front. At grain boundaries such openness is even more pronounced, leaving higher-order branches highly exposed to the incoming solute-rich liquid stream. It was found that streaming of solute-enriched liquid at the tip of high-order branches promotes growth by local undercooling. Further solute advection and local solute rejection due to the local growth causes solute pile-up at the roots of the branches. This solute pile-up alters the local compositional balance at the solid–liquid interface at the root, causing the root to remelt, which in turn results in further branch detachment.},

	abstract = {A quasi-two-dimensional solidification benchmark experiment with controlled thermal boundary conditions is proposed. The experiment consists in solidifying a rectangular ingot of Sn–3 wt.\%Pb alloy using two lateral heat exchangers to extract the heat flux from one or two sides of the sample. The temperature difference between the two sides of the heat exchangers may vary from 0 to 40 K and the cooling rate from 0.02 to 0.04 K/s. This slow-cooling condition has been used to promote segregation formation. An array of fifty thermocouples placed on the corresponding sample walls is used to determine the instantaneous temperature distribution. During the solidification process, the temperature field is recorded versus time and analyzed. This makes it possible to estimate the change in temperature due to natural convection, the velocity field and the solidification macrostructure and segregation behavior. After each experiment, the segregation patterns are obtained by X-ray analysis and confirmed by eutectic fraction measurements. The local solute distribution is determined by means of induction coupled plasma analysis.},

	abstract = {A basic model of the transport phenomena occurring during solidification of multicomponent mixtures is presented. The model is based on a two-phase approach, in which each phase is treated separately and interactions between the phases are considered explicitly. The macroscopic transport equations for each phase are derived using the technique of volumetric averaging. The basic forms of the constitutive relations are developed. These relations link the macroscopic transport phenomena to microscopic processes such as microstructure development, interfacial stresses, and interfacial heat and mass transfer. Thermodynamic relations are presented, and it is shown that nonequilibrium effects can be addressed within the framework of the present model. Various simplifications of the model are examined, and future modeling needs are discussed.},
