	abstract = {A 3-D model of freckle (solute channel) formation at a microstructural level was coupled with in situ X-ray radiography to investigate the mechanisms of freckle initiation and growth. The model predictions for solute partitioning, diffusion and convection were validated via in situ X-ray radiographic measurements in Ga–25 wt.\% In alloy, showing good agreement. Other key features, such as freckle channel width and critical Rayleigh number, also correlated well. The validated model was used to investigate freckle formation under a range of solidification conditions. Two distinct stages of freckle onset were observed, identified via the dendrite tip growth and solute profiles. The first stage corresponds to lower flow velocities with large fluctuations; in the second stage the velocities stabilize, with established recirculating flows forming solute channels. The influence of imperfections in dendritic morphology, such as grain boundaries and primary spacing variations, on the critical Rayleigh number was studied. It was found that that these features initiate freckles. Non-intuitively, converging grain boundaries were observed to have the greatest propensity for freckle formation. The resulting new insights on solute plume formation impact a range of phenomena from single-crystal superalloys to magma flows.},

	abstract = {A three-phase mixed columnar-equiaxed solidification model is used to calculate the macrosegregation in a 2.45 ton steel ingot. The main features of mixed columnar-equiaxed solidification in such an ingot can be quantitatively modelled: growth of columnar dendrite trunks; nucleation, growth and sedimentation of equiaxed crystals; thermosolutal convection of the melt; solute transport by both convection and crystal sedimentation; and the columnar-to-equiaxed transition ({CET}). The predicted as-cast macrostructure and the segregation pattern are in qualitative agreement with the reported experimental results. Parameter study on the numerical grid size and the nucleation of the equiaxed crystals are performed, and some segregation mechanisms are numerically analyzed. Discontinued positive–negative segregation just below the hot top is predicted because of the formation of a local mini-ingot and the subsequent sedimentation of equiaxed grains within the mini-ingot. Quasi A-segregates in the middle radius region between the casting outer surface and the centreline are also found. The quasi A-segregates originate from the flow instability, but both the appearance of equiaxed crystals and their interaction with the growing columnar dendrite tips significantly strengthen the segregates. The appearance of equiaxed phase is not a necessary condition for the formation of quasi A-segregates. The quantitative discrepancy between the predicted and experimental results is also discussed.},

Several algorithm modifications and strategies to maximize parallel efficiency are introduced. Improvements on a real case simulation are measured and discussed. The {CA}?{FE} implementation here is demonstrated using 32 computing units to predict grain structure in a 2.08?m???0.382?m???0.382?m ingot involving 4.9 billion cells and 1.6 million grains. These numerical improvements permit tracking of local changes in texture and grain size over real-cast parts while integrating interactions with macrosegregation, heat flow and fluid flow. Full 3D is essential in all these analyses, and can be dealt with successfully using the implementation presented here.},

	title = {Temperature-based energy solver coupled with tabulated thermodynamic properties - Application to the prediction of macrosegregation in multicomponent alloys},
	abstract = {In the following paper, we present a new algorithm for solving energy balance in phase change problems, particularly in solidification with macrosegregation. The algorithm is based on a nonlinear Newton temperature evaluation using the average enthalpy which is provided by i) tabulated solidification paths  and ii) tabulated phase enthalpies. The compatibility of this method with thermodynamic tabulations allows simulating solidification at equilibrium with multiple phase transformations for binary and multicomponent alloys. It retains its accuracy when capturing the latent heat with respect to the enthalpy method with the advantage of being faster in terms of computation time. The method has been validated and applied to three-dimensional cases with macrosegregation: a binary Sn-3wt\% Pb alloy and a ternary Fe-2 wt\% C-30 wt\% Cr alloy. For the latter case, predictions include composition maps for C and Cr as well as distribution of liquid, {BCC}, {FCC}, M7C3 and Cementite phases},

The present paper proposes a numerical analysis for the formation of freckles using the three dimensional (3D) cellular automaton ({CA}) – finite element ({FE}) model [1]. The model integrates kinetics laws for the nucleation and growth of a microstructure to the solution of the conservation equations for the casting, while introducing an intermediate modeling scale for a direct representation of the envelope of the dendritic grains. Directional solidification of a cuboid cell is studied. Its geometry, the alloy chosen as well as the process parameters are inspired from experimental observations recently reported in the literature [2]. Snapshots of the convective pattern, the solute distribution and the morphology of the growth front are qualitatively compared. Similitudes are found when considering the coupled 3D {CAFE} simulations. Limitations of the model to reach direct simulation of the experiments are discussed.},

	abstract = {The directional solidification of Ga-25wt pct In alloys within a Hele-Shaw cell under the influence of thermosolutal convection was observed by means of X-ray radioscopy. The unstable density stratification at the solidification front causes the formation of rising plumes containing solute-rich liquids. The development of the chimneys and the probability of their surviving depend sensitively on the spatial and temporal properties of the flow field. Variations of the vertical temperature gradient along the solidification cell lead to the observation of different mechanisms for chimney formation. Perturbations of the dendritic structure are the origin of development of segregation freckles in case of low temperature gradients. The long-term stabilities of these segregation channels are strongly influenced by the transient nature of the melt convection. The situation at higher temperature gradients is characterized by two dominating convection rolls in the liquid phase which are driven by a lateral temperature gradient and the convex shape of the solidification front. The penetration of this flow pattern into the mushy zone results in continuous accumulation of solute in the central part of the mushy zone followed by a remelting of the solid fraction and the occurrence of a stable chimney.},

In situ characterization of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition in a refined Al–3.5 wt.\% Ni alloy is achieved by synchrotron X-ray radiography. Two main characteristics are derived from the radiographs for each nucleated grain, namely the nucleation position in the sample and the orientation of the main trunk relative to the vertical temperature gradient. These data are then used as input for the {CA}-{FE} simulations. The {CA}-{FE} model takes into account the effects of macroscopic transport of heat, liquid momentum and solute mass on the development of the dendritic grain structure and vice versa. The influence of convection on macroscopic shape of the growth front, the grain structure, the microstructure distribution and macro-segregation is determined by a comparison between the experimental observations and results from the numerical simulations with and without fluid flow. Good qualitative agreement is obtained and limitations that are linked to the two-dimensional approximation and the need for direct tracking of the eutectic grain structure are pointed out.},

Defects such as A-segregates are still commonplace, and components are regularly scrapped due to their presence, leading to increased economic and environmental costs. With the growth of the nuclear power industry, and the increased demands placed on new pressure vessels, it is now more important than ever that today’s steel ingots are as chemically homogeneous as possible.This article briefly reviews the development of our current understanding of macrosegregation phenomena during the 20th century, before going on to assess the latest developments in the field of macrosegregation modelling. The aim of the text is to highlight the shortcomings of applying contemporary macromodels to steel-ingot casting, and to suggest practical alternatives. In addition, the experimental characterisation of macrosegregation is explored, and a review of the various techniques currently available is presented.},

	abstract = {La formation de la structure de grains dans les métaux pendant la solidification est déterminante pour les propriétés mécaniques et électroniques des pièces coulées. En plus de la texture donnée au matériau, la germination et la croissance des grains sont liées en particulier avec la formation des phases thermodynamiques et les inhomogénéités en composition d'éléments d'alliage. La structure de grains est rarement modélisée à l'échelle macroscopique, d'autant plus que l'approximation 2D est très souvent injustifiée. Dans ces travaux, la germination et la croissance de chaque grain individuel sont suivies avec un modèle macroscopique 3D {CAFE}. La microstructure interne des grains n'est pas explicitement résolue. Pour valider les approximations faites sur cette microstructure, une comparaison directe avec un modèle microscopique 'champ de phase' a été réalisée. Celle-ci a permis de valider les hypothèses de construction du modèle {CAFE}, de mettre en avant le lien entre données calculées par les modèles microscopiques et paramètres d'entrée des modèles à plus grande échelle, et les domaines de validité de chaque modèle. Dans un deuxième temps, un couplage avec la ségrégation chimique et les bases de données thermodynamiques a été mise en place et appliquée sur un alliage binaire étain-plomb. Une expérience de macroségrégation par convection naturelle a été simulée. L'accord entre les courbes de température expérimentales et simulées atteint une précision de l'ordre de 1K, et la recalescence est correctement prédite. Les cartes de compositions sont comparables qualitativement, ainsi que la structure de grains. Les avantages du suivi de la structure ont été mis en évidence par rapport à une simulation par éléments finis classique. De plus, il a été montré que le calcul 3D était ici indispensable. Enfin, une implémentation parallèle optimisée du code a permis d'appliquer le modèle {CAFE} à un lingot de silicium polycristallin industriel de dimensions 0,192 x 0,192 x 2,08m, avec une taille de cellules de 250µm. Au total, 4,9 milliards de cellules sont représentées sur le domaine, et la germination et la croissance de 1,6 million de grains sont suivies.},

The solute enriched interdendritic flow remelts both primary and secondary arms, and can deflect the primaries. This enables solutal channels to become self-sustaining, forming freckles.

This slow-cooling condition has been used to promote segregation formation. An array of fifty thermocouples placed on the corresponding sample walls is used to determine the instantaneous temperature distribution. During the solidification process, the temperature field is recorded versus time and analyzed. This makes it possible to estimate the change in temperature due to natural convection, the velocity field and the solidification macrostructure and segregation behavior.

La deuxième étape, indépendante de la première, revient à calculer uniquement la déformation du solide. Enfin, la dernière étape correspond à la réunion des deux premières. Les équations du problème sont résolues grâce à la méthode des éléments finis à laquelle sont adjointes des méthodes de stabilisation. Pour chacune des étapes, les simulations se basent sur des expériences. Pour la première étape, la validation s'appuie sur l'expérience de Hebditch \& Hunt. Les résultats numériques et expérimentaux concordent. L'expérience qui sert de point de comparaison pour la deuxième étape est l'expérience de la déformation d'une goutte de métal liquide lors de son refroidissement par une plaque en cuivre. Cette expérience a été mise en place par un des partenaires du projet et s'est déroulée en microgravité. La déformation numérique obtenue suit la même tendance que celle de l'expérience mais avec une intensité inférieure. La dernière étape s'est appuyée sur l'expérience de refroidissement pulsé d'un lingot effectuée par El-Bealy. La simulation prévoit des variations de ségrégation mais n'arrive pas à capter toutes les variations expérimentales, conséquences de la déformation du solide. Des calculs sans thermomécanique montrent que notre simulation semble moins sensible à la déformation que l'expérience. L'ensemble des simulations a mis en jeu des alliages binaires. Un cas de solidification d'alliage ternaire sans déformation du solide a été simulé.},

The proposed method starts by the use of a finite element variational multiscale ({VMS}) method, which consists in here of a decomposition for both the velocity and the pressure fields into coarse/resolved scales and fine/unresolved scales. This choice of decomposition is shown to be favorable for simulating flows at high Reynolds number. We explore the behaviour and accuracy of the proposed approximation on three test cases. First, the lid-driven square cavity at Reynolds number up to 50,000 is compared with the highly resolved numerical simulations and second, the lid-driven cubic cavity up to Re = 12,000 is compared with the experimental data. Finally, we study the flow over a 2D backward-facing step at Re = 42,000. Results show that the present implementation is able to exhibit good stability and accuracy properties for high Reynolds number flows with unstructured meshes.},

On the microscopic scale the model takes into account nucleation, finite diffusion in both solid and liquid phases, and resolves the diffusion-controlled phase change by a solute balance at the solid–liquid interface coupled with a thermodynamic equilibrium condition for the interface. The main idea of the paper is the solution algorithm of the multiscale model. We propose and present in detail an operator splitting method that resolves the global conservation equations in two stages. In the first solution stage we resolve and integrate globally only the convection terms. In the second solution stage we resolve and integrate locally the contributions of the grain growth kinetics, i.e. the phase change and the microscopic diffusion. We analyze this splitting method based on a scaling analysis that shows that the justification of the method stems from the separation of time scales of convection, diffusion and phase change. We discuss this scale separation in detail and define a test case that is presented and analyzed in a companion paper.},

Des interprétations sont alors établies sur les comportements non triviaux des alliages Al-Ni solidifiés rapidement. Le modèle proposé permet ainsi d'appréhender les effets concurrents des différentes cinétiques (diffusion chimique, bilan d'énergie, vitesse croissance des microstructures, etc.) lors de la solidification hors équilibre.

	isbn = {9780849382383},
	abstract = {Solidification is one of the oldest processes known for producing complex shapes for applications ranging from art to industry, and today it still remains one of the most important commercial technologies for many materials. Since the 1980s, numerous fundamental developments in the understanding of solidification processes and microstructure formation have been derived from both analytical theories and the application of computational techniques using commonly available powerful computers. This book integrates these developments in a comprehensive volume that also presents and places them in the context of more classical theories. Divided into three sections, the text evolves from fundamentals to applications, giving professional engineers and students a firm understanding that they can readily apply.  The first part, Fundamentals and Macroscale Phenomena, presents the thermodynamics of solutions and then builds on that subject to motivate and describe equilibrium phase diagrams. Transport phenomena are discussed next, focusing on the issues of most importance to liquid-solid phase transformations, then moving on to describe in detail both analytical and numerical approaches to solving such problems.  The second part, Microstructure, employs these fundamental concepts for the treatment of nucleation, dendritic growth, microsegregation, eutectic and peritectic solidication, and microstructure competition. This part concludes with a chapter describing the coupling of macro- and microscopic phenomena in microstructure development.  Defects, the third and final section describes various types of defects that may occur — with emphasis on porosity, hot tearing, and macrosegregation — presented using the modeling tools and microstructure descriptions developed earlier in the text.

@phdthesis{kohler_peritectic_2008,
	title = {Peritectic solidification of Cu-Sn alloys: microstructure competition at low speed},
	abstract = {Many commercially important alloys such as Fe-C, Fe-Ni, Cu-Zn, Cu-Sn and Ti-Al exhibit peritectic transitions on solidification. In the two-solid phase region of peritectic metallic systems, a wide spectrum of microstructures has been revealed during directional solidification experiments at low growth rates, where both α- and β-phases would grow independently as planar fronts [1, 2, 12–20]: discrete bands, islands, simultaneous growth of the α- and β-phases in the form of oriented lamellae or fibers and continuous oscillatory tree-like microstructures in highly convective peritectic systems [3, 21, 22]. Recently, Vandyoussefi et al. [27] and Dobler et al. [16] have done extensive solidification experiments on Fe-Ni alloys in the corresponding two-solid phase region. Depending on the growth conditions and local composition, a lamellar eutectic-like structure was observed. Despite recent works, the peritectic solidification at low growth rate is not fully understood. Additionally, coupled growth was observed only for peritectic systems for which the solidification interval of the primary phase ΔΤ 0α is fairly small and with negligible convection; but is it also possible for peritectic alloys with fairly large ΔΤ 0α such as Cu-Sn? If so, what would be the effect of convection? And finally, is the coupled growth front really isothermal? In the present contribution, the peritectic Cu-Sn system has been chosen because of its remarkable properties and technological importance. Indeed, two essential features distinguish Cu-Sn alloys from other peritectic systems: The equilibrium solidification interval of the a-phase decreases with the tin concentration in the hypoperitectic composition range. Additionally, the equilibrium solidification interval of the primary phase is about 25 times larger in the Cu-Sn system than in the Fe-Ni peritectic system. Since only few studies have been made on the detailed solidification of tin bronze alloys, the first goal of this study was to carry out thermal analyses in order to investigate precisely the solidification of Cu-Sn alloys and to measure temperatures of solid-state phase transformations. Therefore, an {SPTA} assembly has been built and successfully calibrated. Additionally, a heat flow model was developed in this work and coupled with a Cu-Sn thermodynamic database to treat solidification-dependent latent heat. Single pan thermal analyses on three Cu-Sn alloy compositions revealed that the corresponding phase diagram recently re-investigated in Liu et al. review [28] is the most reliable. Directional solidification experiments on Cu-Sn alloys of various compositions have been conducted at different velocities in a high gradient Bridgman furnace. In this context, the set-up already used by Dobler [14] has been modified in order to reduce the size of the samples and, accordingly, natural convection and the associated macrosegregation. During each solidification run, two different geometries were thus tested (3 mm diameter cylinder and 4/6 mm tube), allowing the observation of convection effects on solidifying microstructures. An essential outcome of this project is that α+β lamellar structures have been observed in both sample geometries, even when Vp is above the critical velocity for the α planar front growth, i.e., the α-phase grew with a cellular morphology. With the Cu-Sn phase diagram used in the present work and for positions close to the quenched interface, concentration profiles measured across the lamellar structures revealed that the corresponding operating temperature Τ*(x) seems to be non-isothermal, in contradiction with previous experimental observations in Fe-Ni peritectic alloys [14–16]. But, since the Cu-Sn phase diagram is not assessed accurately, Τ*(x) is still subject to large variations (±10°C). On the other hand, the peritectic transformation after solidification has been evidenced and modifies the compositions and fractions of phases. Additionally, local concentration showed that a partial banding mechanism and an unstable lateral propagation of both solid phases were responsible for the formation of lamellar structures. Various geometrical arrangements were revealed on transverse cuts of lamellar structures: straight α- and β-lamellae, labyrinth-like microstructures, disordered arrays of rods of one phase in the matrix of the other phase and uniform regions of β-phase. The dynamic evolution of lamellar structures was attributed to growth competition mechanisms and instabilities between phases originated from the same nuclei. Finally, it should be noted that the Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship was observed between the primary and the peritectic phases on both the straight lamellae and labyrinth-like microstructure. Finally, all lamellar structures ended by the termination of α-lamellae and the subsequent growth of a β planar front. In this context, the α-lamellae of lamellar structures observed in the 4/6 mm tube exhibited in all cases a "hammer-like" morphology before being overgrown by the peritectic phase. Careful investigations of this morphology revealed that it resulted effectively from growth competition mechanisms, which remain to be fully understood. In a simulated geometry corresponding to the 4/6 mm tube of Cu-Sn samples, 3D macrosegregation modeling revealed that a nearly helical convection pattern existed in the liquid phase ahead of a moving planar α-liquid interface. And between each plume, the fluid flow was mostly oriented parallel to the solid-liquid interface. As a consequence, the lateral propagation of the α- and β-phases during the 3D growth competition was surely affected by these convective motions. Finally, natural convection and the associated solute enrichment were assumed to be responsible for the destabilization of lamellar structures and the subsequent end of α-lamellae. The multi-phase field computations emphasized that the stability of the triple junction between α-, β- and liquid phases is function of the initial alloy concentration C0, of the lamellar spacing λ and of the thermal gradient Gl. In a near future, directional solidification experiments are planned to be conducted onboard of the International Space Station. Then, the obtained peritectic microstructures will have to be compared with the microstructures observed in the present work in order to assess more precisely the effect of natural convection on the formation of lamellar structures.},

At grain boundaries such openness is even more pronounced, leaving higher-order branches highly exposed to the incoming solute-rich liquid stream. It was found that streaming of solute-enriched liquid at the tip of high-order branches promotes growth by local undercooling. Further solute advection and local solute rejection due to the local growth causes solute pile-up at the roots of the branches. This solute pile-up alters the local compositional balance at the solid–liquid interface at the root, causing the root to remelt, which in turn results in further branch detachment.},

The limit between this mushy zone domain and the undercooled liquid melt in which it develops defines the envelope of a single grain. A verification is first performed to check that the {CAFE} model retrieves the solution of a purely {FE} simulation for a vanishing undercooling of the growth front. Since the present 2D {CAFE} model is relevant with respect to the solidification experiment developed by Yin and Koster [H. Yin, J. N. Koster, J. Crystal Growth 205 (1999) 590; H. Yin, J. N. Koster, J. Alloy Compd. 352 (2003) 197], comparison is then performed. In particular, the position of the growth front is considered as a time sequence. The effect of the growth undercooling is clearly revealed. The kinetics of the growth front used in the model assumes the development of a rough interfacial dendrite-like morphology.

The numerical simulation is performed using a fixed-grid single-domain approach in which local remelting and anisotropic variation of mush permeability are taken into account. It is observed that solute-rich liquid rising in the form of finger convection causes delayed growth and localized remelting of portions of the solid/mush interface, resulting in patches of thin structure known as channels. The present study reveals the manner in which the structure of a mushy layer evolves during channel formation. Effects of bulk liquid convection on channel formation, evolution, destruction and the resulting effect on the mush structure are found to be significant.

	doi = {10.2355/isijinternational.46.880},
	abstract = {A coupled Cellular Automaton ({CA})–Finite Element ({FE}) model is presented for the prediction of solidification grain structures coupled with the calculation of solid and liquid flow induced macrosegregation. The model is applied to simulate the solidification of a Pb–48wt\%Sn alloy in a rectangular cavity cooled down from only one of its vertical boundaries. The algorithm and the numerical implementation of the coupling between the {CA} and {FE} methods are first validated by considering a single grain developing with no undercooling. Such a {CAFE} simulation is shown to retrieve the solution of a purely {FE} method simulation for which the grain structure is not accounted for. Several applications of the model are then presented to quantify the effects of the grain structure on the final macrosegregation map. In particular, the effect of the undercooling of the columnar front, the presence of equiaxed grains nucleated in the undercooled liquid, as well as the transport and sedimentation of equiaxed grains are investigated. Although good validation is reached when comparing computed and measured segregation profiles available in the literature for the chosen configuration, it is concluded that refined experimental data are required to further validate the predictions of a coupled {CAFE} model.},

	url = {http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00001339},
	abstract = {This work is dedicated to the modeling of macrosegregation and deformation during solidification of
castings. A two-dimensional finite element model to simulate macrosegregation due to thermal-solutal
convection in the case of columnar dendritic solidification is presented. A set of volume-averaged
conservation equations of energy, solute, momentum and mass is solved in conjunction with the use of the
lever rule as a microsegregation model. Several formulations have been implemented, permitting a
resolution with either weak or strong coupling, closed or open system. In order to improve the prediction
accuracy, an algorithm for dynamic remeshing is proposed. The basic idea is to generate fine elements near
the liquidus isotherm. The norm of the gradient of solid fraction is used for piloting the remeshing in the
mushy zone; while the objective mesh size in the liquid is considered as a function of the distance to the
liquidus isotherm.
The numerical approach has been validated with a benchmark test of macrosegregation in Pb-Sn
alloys taken from the literature. The influences of mesh size, time step and coupling scheme have been
investigated. Sufficient fine meshes, small time step and possibly coupling iterations should be applied in
order to predict segregated channels. Moreover, the efficiency of mesh adaptation is demonstrated by
predictions of freckles in a case of unidirectional solidification, and of ‘A-type’ segregation bands in a large
industrial carbon steel ingot.
In the last part of this work, regarding fluid flow in the liquid induced by solidification
shrinkage and thermo-convection and deformation in the solid, a thermal mechanical model has
been implemented with a Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation. The alloy in the liquid state is
Newtonian, and in the mushy state it is modeled by a viscoplastic continuum. Below a critical
temperature the alloy is considered by a thermal elastic viscoplastic model. The thermo-mechanical
simulation is used to predict the shrinkage pipe, air gap, strains and stresses.},

	abstract = {Mathematical expressions of segregation rates occurring during solidification with spongy deformation of an alloyed mushy zone are derived from classical mass balance analyses. The boundaries of the domain considered for the mass balances deform with the same velocity as the solid phase: the reference frame is attached to the solid phase. The three variables needed to fully describe segregation within this “Lagrangian” approach are the mass of solid in the domain, the volume of the domain and the relative velocity of the liquid with respect to the solid. The main result is a mathematical expression for the local macrosegregation rate. The analysis is further extended to produce an expression for the local microsegregation rate that can be compared with the one proposed by Flemings and Nereo (Trans. {AIME} 239 (1967) 1449–1461). An additional term thus enters into our expression. This term is proportional to the local strain rate multiplied by the ratio of the volume fraction of solid over the volume fraction of liquid. It is expected to become dominant when the mushy zone is fully developed (large value of the ratio) and when the strain can be transmitted through a coherent solid skeleton that deforms like a sponge. Still, the origin of the deformation remains arbitrary and the derived expressions could be used to quantify segregation due to the thermal contraction of the solid and liquid phases, the shrinkage associated with the phase transformations, and/or the mechanical deformation of the domain. Finally, the expression for the local microsegregation rate is combined with the first law of thermodynamics. The rate of progress of solidification is thus related to the rate of heat extraction, the transport of heat due to the relative liquid flow with respect to the solid, and the enthalpy of dissolution of the solid in the liquid.},

	abstract = {A multiphase/multiscale model is used to predict the columnar-to-equiaxed transition ({CET}) during solidification of binary alloys. The model consists of averaged energy and species conservation equations, coupled with nucleation and growth laws for dendritic structures. A new mechanism for the {CET} is proposed based on solutal interactions between the equiaxed grains and the advancing columnar front—as opposed to the commonly used mechanical blocking criterion. The resulting differences in the {CET} prediction are demonstrated for cases where a steady state can be assumed, and a revised isotherm velocity (V T ) vs temperature gradient (G) map for the {CET} is presented. The model is validated by predicting the {CET} in previously performed unsteady, unidirectional solidification experiments involving Al-Si alloys of three different compositions. Good agreement is obtained between measured and predicted cooling curves. A parametric study is performed to investigate the dependence of the {CET} position on the nucleation undercooling and the density of nuclei in the equiaxed zone. Nucleation undercoolings are determined that provide the best agreement between measured and calculated {CET} positions. It is found that for all three alloy compositions, the nucleation undercoolings are very close to the maximum columnar dendrite tip undercoolings, indicating that the origin of the equiaxed grains may not be heterogeneous nucleation, but rather a breakdown or fragmentation of the columnar dendrites.},

	abstract = {A criterion for predicting the formation of freckles for Pb-Sn and Ni-base superalloys is evaluated using available experimental data. The criterion is based on a maximum value of the Rayleigh number, which indicates that the magnitude of buoyancy forces is largest with respect to the retarding frictional forces. The definition of the Rayleigh number involves a characteristic length scale. The two options explored in this study are the distance from the liquid mush interface and the scale represented by the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed. Additionally, two alternative ways of computing the mushy-zone permeability are explored. Only two of the possible combinations of length scales and permeability relations provide a maximum value within the mush that can be chosen as a representative value for the given conditions. It is found that the Rayleigh number that uses the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed as a length scale provides the best separation between freckled and nonfreckled data. Critical values for the Rayleigh number are in the range of 38 to 46 for vertically solidified Pb-Sn and within the range of 30 to 33 for Ni-base superalloys. Although not exactly the same, the proximity of these intervals indicates that the critical Rayleigh number is not very sensitive to alloy-specific system parameters. The influence of sample pulling inclination angle on this critical value is assessed for Ni-base superalloys. A preliminary relationship between the critical Rayleigh number and the inclination angle is developed.},

	abstract = {A numerical method for the simulation of buoyancy-induced macrosegregation during solidification processes is presented. The physical model is based on volume averaged conservation equations for energy, mass, momentum, and solute. The resulting partial differential equations are solved by a finite element method, which considers two different length-scales: on the one hand, the scale of the overall process, on the other, a small critical zone near the solidification front where solutal inhomogeneities are initiated and the fluid velocity is non-zero. A domain decomposition method using two adapted grids has been developed. The overall computational domain is discretized using a `coarse' finite element mesh adapted to the process scale. At each time step, the energy conservation equation is solved using this discretization and new values of temperature and solid fraction are calculated at each finite element node. Based on these values, the computational domain is subdivided into three subdomains: the so-called solid, mushy, and liquid regions. The mushy subdomain corresponds to the critical zone near the solidification front and is adaptively discretized with a finer finite element mesh, whereas the liquid domain uses the initial coarse grid and the solid is no longer considered. The fluid flow and solute transport equations are then solved on the different meshes using a Dirichlet–Neumann substructuring iterative method, together with the mortar technique to deal with the non-conforming discretizations at the subdomain interfaces. The method is applied to several test problems such as the Hebditch–Hunt macrosegregation experiment or the prediction of freckles, and the performances and limits of the approach are pointed out and discussed.},

	abstract = {A Rayleigh number based criterion is developed for predicting the formation of freckles in Ni-base superalloy castings. This criterion relies on finding the maximum local Rayleigh number in the mush, where the ratio of the driving buoyancy force to the retarding frictional force is the largest. A critical Rayleigh number for freckle formation of approximately 0.25 is found from available experimental data on directional solidification of a Ni-base superalloy. If the Rayleigh number in a superalloy casting is below this critical value, freckles are not expected to form. Full numerical simulations of freckling in directional solidification of superalloys are conducted for a large variety of casting conditions, alloy compositions, and inclinations of the system with respect to gravity. For the vertical cases, the Rayleigh numbers at the starting points of the predicted freckles are in good agreement with the critical value established from the experiments. The simulations confirm that the same critical Rayleigh number applies to different superalloys. The simulations for inclined domains show that even a small amount of inclination (less than 10 deg) significantly lowers the critical Rayleigh number and moves the freckles to the side wall of the casting, where the mushy zone has advanced the most relative to gravity. In application of the Rayleigh number criterion to complex-shaped superalloy castings, the absence of freckles near upper and lower boundaries and in sections of insufficient cross-sectional area or height needs to be taken into account as well. The criterion can be used to study the tradeoffs between different superalloy compositions, applied temperature gradients, and casting speeds. Additional experiments, in particular for other superalloys and for a range of inclinations, are desirable to confirm the critical Rayleigh numbers found in the present study.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of a numerical criterion to provide quantitative insight on freckling conditions is critical to the successful manufacture of large superalloy castings. Of the criteria reported in the literature, those based on the Rayleigh number seem best suited to predict the onset of freckle formation. However, in their current form, these criteria cannot explain why freckles develop predominantly at the surface of single crystal ({SX}) castings and at midradius in {VAR}/{ESR} ingots. An experimental Bridgman-type furnace has been built to directionally solidify freckle-prone superalloys, {CMSX}-11B, {RENÉ}88, {NIM}80A, {WASPALOY}, {MAR}-M247, and a variation of {IN}718 with high silicon content, at various angles to the vertical. Under typical industrial solidification conditions (thermal gradient between 500 and 4000 K m−1 (5{\textless}G{\textless}40 °C cm−1) and solidification rate between 1.67×10−5 and 1.0×10−4 m s−1 (1{\textless}R{\textless}6mm min−1)), the results indicate a dependency of freckling on growth front angle likely related to the anisotropy in permeability. A modified Rayleigh criterion has been developed which accounts for directional permeability and orientation of the growth front relative to the gravity vector. Application to the experimental data shows good correlation with the onset of freckling for the range of solidification conditions examined in the study. The approximate threshold value for the modified Rayleigh number was estimated to be for {CMSX}-11B, 0.88, for {RENÉ}88, 0.90, for {NIM}80A, 0.85, for {WASPALOY}, 0.95, for {MAR}-M247, 0.86, and for {IN}718-Si, 0.65.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional solidification model has been developed to study the directional solidification of dendritic alloys. It is based on the resolution of the heat flow equation using a two-interface front tracking technique. The two interfaces are defined by imaginary limits, assumed to be macroscopically flat, which correspond to the positions of the growing dendritic and eutectic interfaces. These delimit the three regions that are considered: liquid, mushy zone and solid. Growth kinetics laws are applied to the interfaces by velocity vs temperature relationships. It was found that, if complete solidification was carried out directionally up to the top of the ingot (i.e. formation of a fully columnar structure), then the velocity of the dendrite tips first increased during the stage of the superheat loss, then decreased when no substantial thermal gradient remained in the liquid ahead of the growing dendritic interface. Applied to directional solidification experiments carried out with aluminium–silicon alloys, the model shows that this maximum velocity was reached when the top position of the mushy zone (i.e. the dendritic interface) reached about two-thirds the length of the ingots. This position being in the vicinity of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition ({CET}) observed in the longitudinal section of the ingots, a {CET} scenario is proposed based on a constrained-to-unconstrained growth transition, leading to breakdown of the columnar dendritic front.},

and Rene 88@ contain relatively high weight percents of 
hardening elements (e.g. Al \& Ti), for a conventionally cast

prime, this class of alloys has increased susceptibility for the 
formation of melt segregation defects, such as freckles. The 
propensity for freckle formation is further aggravated by the need 
for larger diameter ingots to support the trend toward higher 
thrust large diameter fan engines used on wide body twin engine 
aircraft. A review and assessment of production quality control 
techniques for freckle inspection are discussed. An in depth 
microstructural, chemical, and structural characterization is 
presented. The effects of freckle defects on key mechanical 
properties for the design of critical rotating engine components 
are shown. Finally, a brief discussion of a root cause investigation 
on the origin of freckle formation in this alloy class is given.

Heat transfer in the mold and insulation materials, as well as the formation of a shrinkage cavity at the top, is taken into account. The numerical results show the evolution of the temperature, melt velocity, and species concentration fields during solidification. The predicted variation of the macrosegregation of carbon and sulfur along the vertical centerline is compared with measurements from an industrial steel ingot that was sectioned and analyzed. Although generally good agreement is obtained, the neglect of sedimentation of free equiaxed grains prevents the prediction of the zone of negative macrosegregation observed in the lower part of the ingot. It is also shown that the inclusion of the shrinkage cavity at the top and the variation of the final solidification temperature due to macrosegregation is important in obtaining good agreement between the predictions and measurements.},

A recently introduced algorithm was used to calculate the complicated solidification path of alloys of many components, which can accommodate liquidus temperatures that are general functions of liquid concentrations. The calculations are started from an all-liquid state, and the growth of the mushy zone is followed in time. Simulations of a Ni-Al-Ta-W alloy were performed on a rectangular cylinder until complete solidification. The results reveal details of the formation of freckles not previously observed in two-dimensional simulations. Liquid plumes in the form of chimney convection emanate from channels within the mushy zone, with similar qualitative features previously observed in transparent systems. Associated with the formation of channels, there is a complex three-dimensional flow produced by the interaction of the different solutal buoyancies of the alloy solutes. Regions of enhanced solid growth develop around the channel mouths, which are visualized as volcanoes on top of the mushy zone. The prediction of volcanoes differs from our previous calculations with multicomponent alloys in two dimensions, in which the volcanoes were not nearly as apparent. These and other features of freckle formation phenomena are illustrated.},

Although the same parameters are used in both calculations, small differences are observed as a result of the different formulations. In particular, the instabilities appearing in the mushy zone (channels) of the Sn-5 wt pct Pb alloy are more pronounced with the {FVM} formulation as compared with {FEM}, whereas the opposite trend is observed for the Pb-48 wt pct Sn alloy.

Simulation results are presented for a variety of casting speeds and imposed thermal gradients and for two alloy compositions. It is found that for a given alloy composition, the onset of convection and freckle formation occurs at a critical primary dendrite arm spacing, which agrees well with previous experimental findings. The predicted number and shape of the freckle chains in the unstable cases also agree qualitatively with experimental observations. Finally, it is demonstrated how the onset and nature of convection and macrosegregation vary with alloy composition.

The inclusion of shrinkage-driven flow leads to the prediction of the well-known inverse macrosegregation pattern.

	abstract = {“Macrosegregation” represents a class of defects in cast products of serious concern to both alloy producers and users. Many types of macrosegregation result from thermosolutal convection in the solid plus liquid and all-liquid regions of a solidifying alloy, and this has spurred modeling and simulations, which treat the solid plus liquid region (i.e., the mushy zone) as a porous medium of variable porosity and permeability. Simulations include scenarios in which the convection is strong enough to make channels in the mushy zone region, and these channels lead to localized segregates known as “freckles”. Using Pb-10 wt.\% Sn as a model alloy, we simulated vertical solidification with various solidification rates. By sufficiently increasing the cooling rate at the bottom surface, convection can be suppressed enough to prevent the formation of freckles. The simulation is an example of relating microstructural metrics to a macroscopic property of the porous medium used in continuum theory. In this case, the property is the permeability, which is governed by two microstructural metrics: the volume fraction of liquid and a characteristic length in the dendritic microstructure. Permeability data, relevant to columnar dendritic solidification, are reviewed, and recommendations for future work on determining the permeability in terms of microstructural metrics are given.},

On the microscopic scale, the usual conservation equations along with the appropriate interfacial boundary conditions describe the state of the system. However, the solution to these equations in the microscopic scale is not practical because of the complex interfacial geometry in the mushy zone. Instead, the scale at which the system is described is altered by averaging the microscopic equations over some representative elementary volume within the mushy zone, resulting in macroscopic equations that can be used to solve practical problems. For a fraction of liquid equal to unity, the equations reduce to the usual conservation equations for a single-phase liquid. It is also found that the resistance offered by the solid to the flow of interdendritic liquid in the mushy zone is best described by two coefficients, namely, the inverse of permeability and a second-order resistance coefficient. For the flow in columnar dendritic structures, the second-order coefficient along with the permeability should be evaluated experimentally. For the flow in equiaxial dendritic structures(i.e., isotropic media), the inverse of permeability alone is sufficient to quantify the resistance offered by the solid.},

The data are used in regression analyses and simple flow models to arrive at relationships between permeability and the morphology of the solid dendrites. When flow is parallel to the primary dendrite arms, the important morphological aspects are the volume fraction liquid (g L) and the primary dendrite arm spacing (d 1). When flow is normal to the primary dendrite arms, the permeability depends upon the secondary dendrite arm spacing (d 2) as well asd 1 andg L. The parallel permeability is best described by a model based on the Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar flow through a tube; for the normal permeability an empirical multilinear regression gives the best fit to the data. However, those models are not appropriate for extrapolations beyond the range of the available data (0.19≤g L≤0.66), particularly asg L approaches 1. For extrapolations, models based upon the Blake-Kozeny equation for flow through porous media are recommended.},

Inverse segregation was found to exist, and the extent of segregation in the first 50 pct of the ingot solidified agreed well with that calculated from inverse segregation theory based on the flowback of enriched liquid. However, at higher points in the ingot, the solute distribution deviated from the theoretical one. Also, more and bigger shrinkage pores existed in the equiaxed grained ingot than in a columnar grained ingot. It is suggested that the formation of randomly distributed, equiaxed grains restricts the flowback of enriched interdendritic liquid much more than the formation of columnar grains where interdendritic channels exist. In an equiaxed grained ingot solidified vertically from the bottom upward, the hydrostatic pressure becomes insufficient to cause complete flowback of enriched liquid in the latter stages of solidification. This effect causes porosity in the ingot and a solute distribution which deviates from that predicted by the theory of inverse segregation.},

Values ofβ M, βM, andβ mare deduced for equilibrium conditions in the representative alloy systems Al-Cu, Bi-Sb, Fe-C and Pb-Sn. While the volume changeβ Mmay vary only moderately with alloy composition,β mis a strong function of composition and of the temperature of enclosure. The isothermal volume change,β T, equal to the relative density difference between solid and liquid, varies during the freezing process and is strongly dependent upon composition.

	abstract = {The origin of freckles during unidirectional solidification is studied in a transparent, low melting model system, 30 wt pct {NH}4C1-H2O. In 30NH4Cl-H2O, freckles are caused by upward flowing liquid jets in the mushy zone. The jets erode the mushy zone causing localized segregation and start new grains by producing dendritic debris. It is shown that the jets observed in 30NH4C1-H2O are free convection resulting from a density inversion in the mushy zone. A comparison of driving force, thermal transport effects and solute transport effects in 30NH4C1-H2O and metallic systems shows that jets are possible in metallic alloys where light elements segregate normally or heavy elements segregate inversely. It is concluded that freckles in unidirectionally solidified castings and vacuum consumable-electrode ingots are caused by convective jets. It is shown that the tendency to freckle is greatest in alloys with a large density inversion, high thermal diffusivity, low solute diffusivity, and low viscosity. For a given alloy, the driving force for freckling is proportional to the inverse square of the thermal gradient. Erosion by the jets is decreased by increasing the thermal gradient and growth rate. The location of freckles is influenced by mushy zone curvature.},

A critical condition of flow is shown to produce local melting with resulting formation of “channel-type” segregates.

These defects have been observed in nickel base superalloys in both directionally solidified polycrystalline and single crystal ingots. Such ingots exhibit a relatively periodic distribution of vertical freckle trails around their circumference which are particularly suitable for study. This paper investigates the nature of “Freckles,” examines the conditions under which they occur and specifies a set of consistent observations which any successful model for freckling must explain. Visual, chemical, electron probe, metallographic, and X-ray diffraction data are presented which establish the appearance, composition and orientation differences between freckled and normal regions in single crystals of the nickel base superalloys Udimet 700 and Mar-M200. It is shown that the freckle lines are linear assemblies of small random equiaxed grains which are enriched in all but the inversely segregated solute species. Excessive interdendritic porosity and feeding shrinkage are observed in the vicinity of a freckle line. Some correlations of the tendency toward freckling and the geometric distribution of freckle lines are made with growth rate, thermal gradient, and interface shape. The dependence of freckling tendency on composition is examined in the Ni-Al system.},
