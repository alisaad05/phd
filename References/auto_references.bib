	abstract = {Metric tensors play a key role to control the generation of unstructured anisotropic meshes. In practice, the most well established error analysis enables to calculate a metric tensor on an element basis. In this paper, we propose to build a metric field directly at the nodes of the mesh for a direct use in the meshing tools. First, the unit mesh metric is defined and well justified on a node basis, by using the statistical concept of length distribution tensors. Then, the interpolation error analysis is performed on the projected approximate scalar field along the edges. The error estimate is established on each edge whatever the dimension is. It enables to calculate a stretching factor providing a new edge length distribution, its associated tensor and the corresponding metric. The optimal stretching factor field is obtained by solving an optimization problem under the constraint of a fixed number of edges in the mesh. Several examples of interpolation error are proposed as well as preliminary results of anisotropic adaptation for interface and free surface problem using a level set method.},

Interfaces of inclusions and voids are described implicitly using level set functions. An anisotropic meshing – remeshing strategy is employed to track interfaces and ensure the accuracy of finite element calculations. The matrix and inclusions are elastic–plastic materials. The numerical methodology is adopted to study the effect of different parameters such as void or inclusion orientation and domain size. A good agreement is found with available experimental data and those found in the literature. The proposed method is shown to be an efficient promising technique to study ductile damage stages as void nucleation and growth. A demonstration of the method potential is illustrated by studying void growth for a 2D real complex microstructure and for a simple 3D microstructure.},

	abstract = {In finite element simulations dedicated to the modelling of microstructure evolution, the mesh has to be fine enough to: (i) accurately describe the geometry of the constituents; (ii) capture local strain gradients stemming from the heterogeneity in material properties. In this paper, 3D polycrystalline aggregates are discretized into unstructured meshes and a level set framework is used to represent the grain boundaries. The crystal plasticity finite element method is used to simulate the plastic deformation of these aggregates. A mesh sensitivity analysis based on the deformation energy distribution shows that the predictions are, on average, more sensitive near grain boundaries. An anisotropic mesh refinement strategy based on the level set description is introduced and it is shown that it offers a good compromise between accuracy requirements on the one hand and computation time on the other hand. As the aggregates deform, mesh distortion inevitably occurs and ultimately causes the breakdown of the simulations. An automatic remeshing tool is used to periodically reconstruct the mesh and appropriate transfer of state variables is performed. It is shown that the diffusion related to data transfer is not significant. Finally, remeshing is performed repeatedly in a highly resolved 500 grains polycrystal subjected to about 90\% thickness reduction in rolling. The predicted texture is compared with the experimental data and with the predictions of a standard Taylor model.},

	url = {http://www.theses.fr/2004INPL088N},
	abstract = {Mathematical expressions of segregation rates occurring during solidification with spongy deformation of an alloyed mushy zone have been derived from classical mass balance analyses [LesO3]. The boundaries of the domain considered for the mass balances deform with the same velocity as the solid phase: the reference frame is attached to the solid phase. The three variables needed to fully describe segregation within this "Lagrangian" approach are the mass of solid in the domain, the volume of the domain and the relative velocity of the liquid with respect to the solid. The main result is a mathematical expression for the local macrosegregation rate. The analysis is further extended to produce an expression for the local microsegregation rate that can be compared with a previously proposed expression [Fle67]. It appears that an additional term is found to enter into our expression. This term is proportional to the local strain rate multiplied by the ratio of the volume fraction of solid over the volume fraction of liquid. It is expected to become dominant when the mushy zone is fully developed (large value of the ratio) and when the strain can be transmitted through a coherent solid skeleton that deforms like a sponge. Still, the origin of the deformation remains arbitrary and the derived expressions could be used to quantify segregation due to the thermal contraction of the solid and liquid phases, the shrinkage associated with the phase transformations, and/or the mechanical deformation of the domain. The mathematical expression for the local macrosegregation rate is combined with a numerical one dimensional model of the heat flow previously developed for the study of directional solidification of an undercooled mushy zone using an Eulerian frame of reference [GanOO]. The local strain rate is first deduced from a simple thermomechanical analysis. It gives access to the velocity of the solid phase in a region of the mushy zone located below a given temperature, known as temperature of coherence. The value of the latter is arbitrarily fIXed. The velocity of the solid phase then enters the total mass balance for the determination of the liquid flow due to shrinkage and contraction of both the solid and liquid phases. Finally, the fields for the temperature, velocities of the solid and liquid phases, and average composition are deduced using a fully coupled iterative scheme. Ln addition to inverse segregation close to the mold and negative segregation at the ingot end due to porosity formation [Rou95], segregation induced by deformation and growth undercooling of the columnar growth front are predicted. Application to the solidification of the skin of steel cast products agree qualitatively weil with experimental observations.},

	abstract = {According to many studies on the formation of the V segregation, the formation seems to be affected by the following three factors; the thermal state, the gravitational action, and the dendrite morphology. In order to show how the V segregation would be influenced when each factor was varied independently or mutually, some investigations were made on sand-cast ingots.The results obtained are summarized as follows:1) The V segregation appeared in the acceralated solidification area of small ta pered ingots with a large ratio of height to diameter; the area did not suffer the both end and riser effects.2) The gravity itself did not have any direct effect on the V segregation, but the shape of the segregation was rather influenced by the change of dendrite morphology and the distributio n of chemical compositions which were caused by the gravity action.3) The V segregation tended to disappear with an increase of the amount of taper. With the great taper, the concentrated melts to become the V segregation was found to be squeezed from the area corresponding to the V segregation zone toward the feeder head with the progress of solidification.A discussion was made on the formation mechanism of the V segregation based upon the results described above, and the theory of the suction by the volume shrinkage of molten steel on solidification could well explain the experimental results.},

The energy concentration, the mask effects and the laser polarization can directly affect the molten pool dynamic.

The method has the advantage to be easily coupled with heat transfer and fluid flow equations and can be immediately transposable in any 2D, 2D axi or 3D configurations. The reliability and limits of this approach are discussed through different numerical examples. The complete model takes into account the three phases of the matter: the vaporized metal, the liquid phase and the solid base. To predict the evolution of these three phases, coupled equations of energy, continuity, momentum and Maxwell are solved. The liquid/vapour interface is tracked using the level-set method. All these physics are solved simultaneously with the commercial code COMSOL Multiphysics{\textregistered}. The calculated temperatures, velocities and free surface deformation are analysed. Examples of simulations leading to the formation of porosity are also presented. Finally, melt pool shapes evolution are compared to experimental macrographs.},

It is shown that there is a {\textquoteleft}characteristic{\textquoteright} SDAS for each alloy at a particular cooling rate, and reducing the grain size causes the grain morphology to change from dendritic to cellular/rosette-like to globular or spherical. Increasing the cooling rate refines both the SDAS and the grain size, but reduces the SDAS more rapidly leading to finer, more dendritic grain structures.

The derivation starts from the balance equations for a sharp interface and uses an ensemble averaging procedure on an atomic scale to obtain a diffuse interface version of the equations. As opposed to thermodynamically derived models, the two phases are assumed to coexist inside the diffuse interface with different properties, velocities, and pressures. Separate conservation equations are solved for each phase. The phase interactions are modeled explicitly through the inclusion of interfacial forces in the momentum equations for each phase. Based on a superposition of microscopic (atomic-scale) and macroscopic interface morphologies, an expression for the interfacial momentum source due to surface tension is introduced that is equivalent to the capillary stress term encountered in thermodynamically derived models. Also, a constitutive relation for the average viscous stresses of each phase inside the diffuse interface is presented. The model is tested for simple one-dimensional flows tangential and normal to a diffuse interface, and the results are compared to those obtained from a thermodynamically derived model.},

Simulation results are presented for a variety of casting speeds and imposed thermal gradients and for two alloy compositions.

	abstract = {This paper addresses dendritic equiaxed growth during grain structure formation in alloy solidification, and focuses on the growth and interaction of primary dendrite arms, which drive and limit grain development, respectively. Dedicated solidification experiments on Al{\textendash}10 wt.\% Cu alloy were carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, enabling live observation by in situ and real-time synchrotron X-ray radiography. Equiaxed solidification was achieved by cooling nearly isothermal samples, and the growth of the grains was continuously monitored from the very early stages of solidification up to a state where changes in grain structure were no longer visible to the observer{\textquoteright}s naked eye. The time evolution of individual equiaxed grains is analysed through measurements of the lengths and tip velocities of the primary dendrite arms driving grain growth. It is found that equiaxed dendrite propagation is characterized by two growth regimes. The first regime, in which a gradual increase in the tip growth rate is observed, corresponds to free dendritic growth, when the relative distance between grains is large enough to consider a grain as isolated. During this regime, the far-field liquid concentration ahead of the advancing dendrite tip remains constant, equal to the initial alloy composition, and the driving force for growth is the undercooling applied by cooling of the sample, in agreement with three-dimensional models of free dendritic growth. The second regime shows a decrease in the tip velocity towards zero and is attributed to grain interaction when the solute diffusion field in front of the advancing dendrite tip under consideration overlaps with the solute field associated with the growth of the grain(s) facing it. Solute concentration profiles are measured in the extra dendritic liquid ahead of dendrite tips interacting with neighbour grains, from which the far-field solute concentration and neighbour{\textendash}interaction distance are deduced. These measurements confirm that impingement of the solute boundary layers is the main cause of dendrite growth being slowed down and stopped.},

X-ray radiography enabled a detailed analysis of the evolution over time of the solid{\textendash}liquid interface macroscopic shape in interaction with convection in the melt. Lateral solute segregation induced by fluid flow resulted in a significant deformation of the solid{\textendash}liquid interface. The time-dependent velocity of the solidification front was determined at different abscissa values along the curved interface during the solidification process, from the growth phase with a smooth interface to the onset of morphological instability. Further, using a novel quantitative image analysis technique we were able to measure longitudinal solute profiles in the melt during the initial transient. Solutal length was then deduced as well as concentration in the melt, both at the interface and far away from it. The influence of convection on growth velocity and the characteristic parameters of the solute boundary layer are discussed, and a comparison with the Warren and Langer model is also presented.},

The proposed method starts by the use of a finite element variational multiscale (VMS) method, which consists in here of a decomposition for both the velocity and the pressure fields into coarse/resolved scales and fine/unresolved scales. This choice of decomposition is shown to be favorable for simulating flows at high Reynolds number. We explore the behaviour and accuracy of the proposed approximation on three test cases. First, the lid-driven square cavity at Reynolds number up to 50,000 is compared with the highly resolved numerical simulations and second, the lid-driven cubic cavity up to Re = 12,000 is compared with the experimental data. Finally, we study the flow over a 2D backward-facing step at Re = 42,000. Results show that the present implementation is able to exhibit good stability and accuracy properties for high Reynolds number flows with unstructured meshes.},

The data are used in regression analyses and simple flow models to arrive at relationships between permeability and the morphology of the solid dendrites. When flow is parallel to the primary dendrite arms, the important morphological aspects are the volume fraction liquid (g L) and the primary dendrite arm spacing (d 1). When flow is normal to the primary dendrite arms, the permeability depends upon the secondary dendrite arm spacing (d 2) as well asd 1 andg L. The parallel permeability is best described by a model based on the Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar flow through a tube; for the normal permeability an empirical multilinear regression gives the best fit to the data. However, those models are not appropriate for extrapolations beyond the range of the available data (0.19<=g L<=0.66), particularly asg L approaches 1. For extrapolations, models based upon the Blake-Kozeny equation for flow through porous media are recommended.},

The role of finger convection and remelting on the structure of a mushy layer containing channels is studied. The numerical simulation is performed using a fixed-grid single-domain approach in which local remelting and anisotropic variation of mush permeability are taken into account. It is observed that solute-rich liquid rising in the form of finger convection causes delayed growth and localized remelting of portions of the solid/mush interface, resulting in patches of thin structure known as channels. The present study reveals the manner in which the structure of a mushy layer evolves during channel formation. Effects of bulk liquid convection on channel formation, evolution, destruction and the resulting effect on the mush structure are found to be significant. Numerical prediction with regard to variation of the number of channels with time agrees qualitatively with published experimental results.},

Other key features, such as freckle channel width and critical Rayleigh number, also correlated well. The validated model was used to investigate freckle formation under a range of solidification conditions. Two distinct stages of freckle onset were observed, identified via the dendrite tip growth and solute profiles. The first stage corresponds to lower flow velocities with large fluctuations; in the second stage the velocities stabilize, with established recirculating flows forming solute channels. The influence of imperfections in dendritic morphology, such as grain boundaries and primary spacing variations, on the critical Rayleigh number was studied. It was found that that these features initiate freckles. Non-intuitively, converging grain boundaries were observed to have the greatest propensity for freckle formation.

Although the same parameters are used in both calculations, small differences are observed as a result of the different formulations. In particular, the instabilities appearing in the mushy zone (channels) of the Sn-5 wt pct Pb alloy are more pronounced with the FVM formulation as compared with FEM, whereas the opposite trend is observed for the Pb-48 wt pct Sn alloy.

The calculations are started from an all-liquid state, and the growth of the mushy zone is followed in time. Simulations of a Ni-Al-Ta-W alloy were performed on a rectangular cylinder until complete solidification. The results reveal details of the formation of freckles not previously observed in two-dimensional simulations. Liquid plumes in the form of chimney convection emanate from channels within the mushy zone, with similar qualitative features previously observed in transparent systems. Associated with the formation of channels, there is a complex three-dimensional flow produced by the interaction of the different solutal buoyancies of the alloy solutes. Regions of enhanced solid growth develop around the channel mouths, which are visualized as volcanoes on top of the mushy zone. The prediction of volcanoes differs from our previous calculations with multicomponent alloys in two dimensions, in which the volcanoes were not nearly as apparent. These and other features of freckle formation phenomena are illustrated.},

The model is applied to simulate the solidification of a Pb{\textendash}48wt\%Sn alloy in a rectangular cavity cooled down from only one of its vertical boundaries. The algorithm and the numerical implementation of the coupling between the CA and FE methods are first validated by considering a single grain developing with no undercooling. Such a CAFE simulation is shown to retrieve the solution of a purely FE method simulation for which the grain structure is not accounted for. Several applications of the model are then presented to quantify the effects of the grain structure on the final macrosegregation map. In particular, the effect of the undercooling of the columnar front, the presence of equiaxed grains nucleated in the undercooled liquid, as well as the transport and sedimentation of equiaxed grains are investigated. Although good validation is reached when comparing computed and measured segregation profiles available in the literature for the chosen configuration, it is concluded that refined experimental data are required to further validate the predictions of a coupled CAFE model.},

	abstract = {A general framework for the calculation of micro-macrosegregation during solidification of metallic alloys is presented. In particular, the problems of back diffusion in the primary solid phase, of eutectic precipitation at the end of solidification, and of remelting are being addressed for an open system,i.e., for a small-volume element whose overall solute content is not necessarily constant. Assuming that the variations of enthalpy and of solute content are known from the solution of the macroscopic continuity equations, a model is derived which allows for the calculation of the local solidification path (i.e., cooling curve, volume fraction of solid, and concentrations in the liquid and solid phases). This general framework encompasses four microsegregation models for the diffusion in the solid phase: (1) an approximate solution based upon an internal variable approach; (2) a modification of this based upon a power-law approximation of the solute profile; (3) an approach which approximates the solute profile in the primary phase by a cubic function; and (4) a numerical solution of the diffusion equation based upon a coordinate transformation. These methods are described and compared for several situations, including solidification/remelting of a closed/open volume element whose enthalpy and solute content histories are known functions of time. It is shown that the solidification path calculated with method 2 is more accurate than using method 1, and that 2 is a very good approximation in macrosegregation calculations. Furthermore, it is shown that method 3 is almost identical to that obtained with a numerical solution of the diffusion equation (method 4). Although the presented results pertain to a simple binary alloy, the framework is general and can be extended to multicomponent systems.},

Projection method for Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations was adopted and the algorithm was implemented in finite element method. The numerical example shows that though in those cases where the layer of liquid metal above is lighter than that below, the interface is not always stable for density ratios less than one of the two liquid metals. The stability of the interface is sensitive to the density ratio and inlet velocity and relatively insensitive to the viscosity ratio or other parameters.

On the microscopic scale the model takes into account nucleation, finite diffusion in both solid and liquid phases, and resolves the diffusion-controlled phase change by a solute balance at the solid{\textendash}liquid interface coupled with a thermodynamic equilibrium condition for the interface. The main idea of the paper is the solution algorithm of the multiscale model. We propose and present in detail an operator splitting method that resolves the global conservation equations in two stages. In the first solution stage we resolve and integrate globally only the convection terms. In the second solution stage we resolve and integrate locally the contributions of the grain growth kinetics, i.e. the phase change and the microscopic diffusion. We analyze this splitting method based on a scaling analysis that shows that the justification of the method stems from the separation of time scales of convection, diffusion and phase change. We discuss this scale separation in detail and define a test case that is presented and analyzed in a companion paper.},

	abstract = {We report the results of quantitative phase-field simulations of the dendritic crystallization of a pure melt in two and three dimensions. These simulations exploit a recently developed thin-interface limit of the phase-field model [A. Karma and W.-J. Rappel, Phys. Rev. E 53, R3017 (1996)], which is given here a detailed exposition. This limit makes it possible to perform efficient computations with a smaller ratio of capillary length to interface thickness and with an arbitrary interface kinetic coefficient. Simulations in one and two dimensions are first carried out to test the accuracy of phase-field computations performed within this limit. Dendrite tip velocities and tip shapes are found to be in excellent quantitative agreement with exact numerical benchmarks of solvability theory obtained by a boundary integral method, both with and without interface kinetics. Simulations in three dimensions exploit, in addition to the asymptotics, a methodology to calculate grid corrections due to the surface tension and kinetic anisotropies. They are used to test basic aspects of dendritic growth theory that pertain to the selection of the operating state of the tip and to the three-dimensional morphology of needle crystals without sidebranches. For small crystalline anisotropy, simulated values of $\sigma$* are slightly larger than solvability theory predictions computed by the boundary integral method assuming an axisymmetric shape, and agree relatively well with experiments for succinonitrile given the uncertainty in the measured anisotropy. In contrast, for large anisotropy, simulated $\sigma$* values are significantly larger than the predicted values. This disagreement, however, does not signal a breakdown of solvability theory. It is consistent with the finding that the amplitude of the cos4$\varphi$ mode, which measures the departure of the tip morphology from a shape of revolution, increases with anisotropy. This departure can therefore influence the tip selection in a way that is not accurately captured by the axisymmetric approximation for large anisotropy. Finally, the tail shape at a distance behind the tip that is large compared to the diffusion length is described by a linear law r\~{}z with a slope dr/dz that is nearly equal to the ratio of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional steady-state tip velocities. Furthermore, the evolution of the cross section of a three-dimensional needle crystal with increasing distance behind the tip is nearly identical to the evolution of a two-dimensional growth shape in time, in accord with the current theory of the three-dimensional needle crystal shape.},

An experimental study of the amount of porosity in laboratory scale (250{\texttimes}400 mm cross-section) DC cast ingots of Al 2, 4 and 6 wt.\% Mg was performed.

	abstract = {A level set method combining features of front tracking methods and fixed domain methods is presented to model microstructure evolution in the solidification of multi-component alloys. Phase boundaries are tracked by solving the multi-phase level set equations. Diffused interfaces are constructed from these tracked phase boundaries using the level set functions. Based on the assumed diffused interfaces, volume-averaging techniques are applied for energy, species and momentum transport. Microstructure evolution in multi-component alloy systems is predicted using realistic material parameters. The methodology avoids the difficulty of parameter identification needed in other diffused interface models, and allows easy application to various practical alloy systems. Techniques including fast marching, narrow band computing and adaptive meshing are utilized to speed up computations. Several numerical examples are considered to validate the method and examine its potential for modeling solidification of practical alloy systems. These examples include two- and three-dimensional solidification of a binary alloy in an undercooled melt, a study of planar/cellular/dendritic transition in the solidification of a Ni{\textendash}Cu alloy, and eutectic and peritectic solidification of an Fe{\textendash}C system. Adaptive mesh refinement in the rapidly varying interface region makes the method practical for coupling the microstructure evolution at the meso-scale with buoyancy driven flow in the macro-scale, which is shown in the solidification of a Ni{\textendash}Al{\textendash}Ta ternary alloy.},

The basis of the formulation is the streamline upwind concept, which provides an accurate multidimensional generalization of optimal one-dimensional upwind schemes. When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods.

The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100.},

Thermocouples were distributed to measure the cooling rate at six different locations of the wedge casts. Solute redistribution profiles were drawn based on the chemical composition analysis obtained by EDS/WDS analysis. Microstructural and morphological features such as dendrite arm spacing and secondary phase particle size were analyzed using both optical and scanning electron microscopes. Dendritic arm spacing and secondary phase particle size showed an increasing trend with decreasing cooling rate for the three alloys. Area percentage of secondary phase particles decreased with decreasing cooling rate for AE44 alloy. The trend was different for AZ91D and AM60B alloys, for both alloys, area percentage of \&\#x3B2;-Mg17Al12 increased with decreasing cooling rate up to location 4 and then decreased slightly. The tendency for microsegregation was more severe at slower cooling rates, possibly due to prolonged back diffusion. At slower cooling rate, the minimum concentration of aluminum at the dendritic core was lower compared to faster cooled locations. The segregation deviation parameter and the partition coefficient were calculated from the experimentally obtained data.},

The goal of this work is to illustrate the influence of the microsegregation phenomena on the macrosegregation. A microsegregation model for multicomponent steel alloys has been developed which takes into account solutal diffusion in solid and liquid phases, a correct description of the multicomponent phase diagram, and the variation of the local average solute concentration (open system). The peritectic transformation has been tackled and specific attention has been drawn on the accurate determination of the $\delta$/$\gamma$ and $\gamma$/liquid interface movements during solidification.

The benchmark quantities: circularity, center of mass, and mean rise velocity are defined and measured to monitor convergence toward a reference solution. Comprehensive studies are undertaken by three independent research groups, two representing Eulerian level set finite-element codes and one representing an arbitrary Lagrangian{\textendash}Eulerian moving grid approach. The first benchmark test case considers a bubble with small density and viscosity ratios, which undergoes moderate shape deformation. The results from all codes agree very well allowing for target reference values to be established. For the second test case, a bubble with a very low density compared to that of the surrounding fluid, the results for all groups are in good agreement up to the point of break up, after which all three codes predict different bubble shapes. This highlights the need for the research community to invest more effort in obtaining reference solutions to problems involving break up and coalescence. Other research groups are encouraged to participate in these benchmarks by contacting the authors and submitting their own data.

The main features of mixed columnar-equiaxed solidification in such an ingot can be quantitatively modelled: growth of columnar dendrite trunks; nucleation, growth and sedimentation of equiaxed crystals; thermosolutal convection of the melt; solute transport by both convection and crystal sedimentation; and the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET). The predicted as-cast macrostructure and the segregation pattern are in qualitative agreement with the reported experimental results. Parameter study on the numerical grid size and the nucleation of the equiaxed crystals are performed, and some segregation mechanisms are numerically analyzed. Discontinued positive{\textendash}negative segregation just below the hot top is predicted because of the formation of a local mini-ingot and the subsequent sedimentation of equiaxed grains within the mini-ingot. Quasi A-segregates in the middle radius region between the casting outer surface and the centreline are also found. The quasi A-segregates originate from the flow instability, but both the appearance of equiaxed crystals and their interaction with the growing columnar dendrite tips significantly strengthen the segregates. The appearance of equiaxed phase is not a necessary condition for the formation of quasi A-segregates. The quantitative discrepancy between the predicted and experimental results is also discussed.},

	abstract = {A criterion for predicting the formation of freckles for Pb-Sn and Ni-base superalloys is evaluated using available experimental data. The criterion is based on a maximum value of the Rayleigh number, which indicates that the magnitude of buoyancy forces is largest with respect to the retarding frictional forces. The definition of the Rayleigh number involves a characteristic length scale. The two options explored in this study are the distance from the liquid mush interface and the scale represented by the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed. Additionally, two alternative ways of computing the mushy-zone permeability are explored. Only two of the possible combinations of length scales and permeability relations provide a maximum value within the mush that can be chosen as a representative value for the given conditions. It is found that the Rayleigh number that uses the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the casting speed as a length scale provides the best separation between freckled and nonfreckled data. Critical values for the Rayleigh number are in the range of 38 to 46 for vertically solidified Pb-Sn and within the range of 30 to 33 for Ni-base superalloys. Although not exactly the same, the proximity of these intervals indicates that the critical Rayleigh number is not very sensitive to alloy-specific system parameters. The influence of sample pulling inclination angle on this critical value is assessed for Ni-base superalloys. A preliminary relationship between the critical Rayleigh number and the inclination angle is developed.},

	url = {https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-01038028/document},
	abstract = {Grain structure formation during fusion welding processes has a significant impact on the mechanical strength of the joint. Defects such as hot cracking are also linked to the crystallographic texture formed during the solidification step. Direct simulation of three-dimensional (3D) grain structure at industrial scale for welding processes is rarely modeled. In this work, a 3D coupled Cellular Automaton (CA) - Finite Element (FE) model is proposed to predict the grain structure formation during multiple passes Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) and Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW). At the macroscopic scale, the FE model solves the mass, energy and momentum conservation equations for the whole system based on an adaptive mesh. For GMAW with metal addition, the FE model is enriched and established in a level set (LS) approach in order to model the evolution of the metal/air interface due to the weld bead development. The FE domain then contains the workpiece and the surrounding air where the weld bead forms. FE computations are coupled with the CA approach used to model the grain structure evolution. A fixed mesh, referred to as CA mesh, is superimposed to the adaptive FE mesh. FE fields are interpolated between the adaptive FE mesh and the fixed CA mesh. A new dynamic allocation/deallocation strategy of a CA grid of cells is then used based on the dynamic activation/deactivation of the elements of the CA mesh. The CA grid is made of a regular lattice of cubic cells superimposed onto the welded domain. At the micro scale, this grid is used in order to simulate the melting and solidification steps at the boundaries between the mushy domain and the liquid pool during the welding process. The temperature evolutions of the cells are computed by interpolation from the CA mesh. Coupling with tabulated transformation paths and phase enthalpy is also implemented, which permits to track the phase amount and latent heat release during the process. In order to master the resolution time and memory cost of the simulations, a management of the FE/CA mesh dimensions and CA cell size is considered for both FE and CA models. The 3D CAFE model is applied to simulate the formation of solidification structures during multiple passes GTAW and GMAW processes on a duplex stainless steel UR 2202. In GTAW, the evolution of the grain structures with respect to the welding process parameters is considered. The normal orientation of the grains with the increase of the heat source velocity is shown. In GMAW, the model is shown to compute the remelting and growth of successively deposited layers. Overall, the predicted structures qualitatively reveal the expected evolutions presented in the literature.},

In situ characterization of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition in a refined Al{\textendash}3.5 wt.\% Ni alloy is achieved by synchrotron X-ray radiography. Two main characteristics are derived from the radiographs for each nucleated grain, namely the nucleation position in the sample and the orientation of the main trunk relative to the vertical temperature gradient. These data are then used as input for the CA-FE simulations. The CA-FE model takes into account the effects of macroscopic transport of heat, liquid momentum and solute mass on the development of the dendritic grain structure and vice versa. The influence of convection on macroscopic shape of the growth front, the grain structure, the microstructure distribution and macro-segregation is determined by a comparison between the experimental observations and results from the numerical simulations with and without fluid flow. Good qualitative agreement is obtained and limitations that are linked to the two-dimensional approximation and the need for direct tracking of the eutectic grain structure are pointed out.},

	abstract = {The breakdown of single-crystal solidification has been studied over a wide range of solidification conditions in ten superalloys with large variations in Re, Ta, and W content. Over the range of experimental conditions investigated, grain defect formation was sensitive to local thermaland solutal conditions. For a fixed alloy composition and withdrawal rate, the transition from single-crystal to equiaxed solidification did not occur abruptly. Instead, as thermal gradients were decreased in a series of experiments, isolated, highly misoriented columnar grains with the same composition as that of the base alloy developed in the presence of positive (stabilizing) thermal gradients with increasing frequency until the advance of the single-crystal front was completely blocked. The onset of columnar grain formation occurred when the primary dendrite arm spacing exceeded a critical value, corresponding to a morphological transition in the dendritic array. The onset of {\textquotedblleft}freckling{\textquotedblright} was observed at the same primary dendrite arm spacing where misoriented columnar grains began to appear. In experiments with varying levels of refractory alloy content, there was also a strong correlation between the onset of grain formation and freckle formation. These observations strongly suggest that in high refractory content superalloys, the breakdown of single-crystal solidification and the formation of misoriented grains as well as freckle-type defects are sensitively dependent on thermosolutal convection processes.},

	abstract = {Nickel base superalloys, such as Gatorizable Waspaloy@, U-720@, 
and Rene 88@ contain relatively high weight percents of 
hardening elements (e.g. Al \& Ti), for a conventionally cast 
(VlM/VAR or VIM/ESR/VAR) and wrought (press and or rotary 
forged) product. Due to the higher volume fraction of gamma 
prime, this class of alloys has increased susceptibility for the 
formation of melt segregation defects, such as freckles. The 
propensity for freckle formation is further aggravated by the need 
for larger diameter ingots to support the trend toward higher 
thrust large diameter fan engines used on wide body twin engine 
aircraft. A review and assessment of production quality control 
techniques for freckle inspection are discussed. An in depth 
microstructural, chemical, and structural characterization is 
presented. The effects of freckle defects on key mechanical 
properties for the design of critical rotating engine components 
are shown. Finally, a brief discussion of a root cause investigation 
on the origin of freckle formation in this alloy class is given.

Phys.79, 12) and address two important issues that are intrinsic to the level set method: (a) how to extend a quantity that is given only on the interface to a neighborhood of the interface; (b) how to reset the level set function to be a signed distance function to the interface efficiently without appreciably moving the interface. This fast local level set method reduces the computational effort by one order of magnitude, works in as much generality as the original one, and is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Our approach differs from previous related works in that we extract all the information needed from the level set function (or functions in multiphase flow) and do not need to find explicitly the location of the interface in the space domain. The complexity of our method to do tasks such as extension and distance reinitialization is O(N), where N is the number of points in space, not O(N log N) as in works by Sethian (1996, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 93, 1591) and Helmsen and co-workers (1996, SPIE Microlithography IX, p. 253). This complexity estimation is also valid for quite general geometrically based front motion for our localized method.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional solidification model has been developed to study the directional solidification of dendritic alloys. It is based on the resolution of the heat flow equation using a two-interface front tracking technique. The two interfaces are defined by imaginary limits, assumed to be macroscopically flat, which correspond to the positions of the growing dendritic and eutectic interfaces. These delimit the three regions that are considered: liquid, mushy zone and solid. Growth kinetics laws are applied to the interfaces by velocity vs temperature relationships. It was found that, if complete solidification was carried out directionally up to the top of the ingot (i.e. formation of a fully columnar structure), then the velocity of the dendrite tips first increased during the stage of the superheat loss, then decreased when no substantial thermal gradient remained in the liquid ahead of the growing dendritic interface. Applied to directional solidification experiments carried out with aluminium{\textendash}silicon alloys, the model shows that this maximum velocity was reached when the top position of the mushy zone (i.e. the dendritic interface) reached about two-thirds the length of the ingots. This position being in the vicinity of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) observed in the longitudinal section of the ingots, a CET scenario is proposed based on a constrained-to-unconstrained growth transition, leading to breakdown of the columnar dendritic front.},

Specifically, calculations are carried out for 0.7 pct C steel, by considering heat, mass and momentum transport in the mushy zone. In the model used for calculations the momentum transport equation and the energy equation were solved simultaneously. It is confirmed, by comparing calculated results with experimental results, that this model successfully predicts the occurrence of channel-type segregation. This analysis is also more rigorous than previous works on macrosegregation because previous analyses were done by solving for convection in the mushy zone with an {\textquotedblleft}uncoupled{\textquotedblright} temperature field. Using the model, the effects of adjusting the compositions of silicon and molybdenum in steel were quantitatively evaluated in order to show how channel-type segregates can be avoided by adjusting alloy composition. A method of optimizing composition to minimize segregation is presented. It is recommended that this methodology be applied to alloy design so that ingots of alloys amenable to commercial practice can be obtained readily with a minimum amount of {\textquotedblleft}trial-and-error{\textquotedblright} development work and expense.},

Detailed thermal measurements, chemical composition measurements (dendrite composition, fraction of interdendritic eutectic formed), and microstructural characterization (primary and secondary dendrite arm spacing measurements) were carried out. Normal macrosegregation was observed in the Pb-rich alloys, with Sn content being highest at the top of the ingot. In the Pb-15 wt pct Sn alloys, macrosegregation was found to increase with increasing thermal gradients, and also with decreasing cooling rates. In some of our experiments with Pb-rich alloys it was possible to induce severe segregation, in the form of deep freckles. The freckles were in the form of a column of tin-rich material which extended over the upper half of the ingot. No significant macrosegregation was evident in the Sn-rich alloy for the growth conditions employed here. Segregation behavior of all ingots was correlated with the measured thermal history, compositional data, and the fraction eutectic phase in the finally solidified samples.},

	abstract = {This work first presents a new multi-scales modeling approach of grain structures solidification and its associated segregation pattern in the as-cast state. It is based upon a semi-analytical description of the chemical length scales built in the solid and outside the envelope of the grains. Originality lies in the account of both the primary and the eutectic structure nucleation undercooling. The model has been applied for Al{\textendash}Cu sample with spontaneous nucleation processed by the Electromagnetic Levitation (EML) technique. The EML technique is used as an experimental model to process Aluminum{\textendash}Copper spherical samples with different copper compositions. For each sample, nucleation has been either spontaneous or triggered using an alumina plate. Various degrees of undercooling have been measured prior to the primary and the eutectic structure nucleation events. Extensive metallurgical characterizations have been performed over a median cutting plane for each sample using a scanning electron microscope(SEM) equipped with energy{\textendash}dispersive X-ray spectrometry and analyses of SEM images. A complete set of data has been elaborated consisting of the distribution maps drawn for the average copper composition, the volume fraction of the eutectic structure, the dendrite arm spacing and their averaged values over the same cutting plane. Segregation has been measured and found to be strongly correlated with the eutectic and the dendrite arm spacing maps. Application of the model shows that the nucleation undercooling of the eutectic structure is a key parameter for a quantitative prediction of the fraction of phases in the solidified samples. In addition, a two-dimensional Cellular Automaton - Finite Element (2D CAFE) model is developed to investigate the segregation maps and the non-equilibrium temperature evolution for samples with spontaneous and triggered nucleation. The model integrates the microsegregation model in each CA cell taking into account the primary phase nucleation undercooling and back diffusion in the solid phase. Additional microstructural features considered are the primary and the secondary dendrite arm spacing. Heat, mass and momentum conservation equations over the simulation domain are solved using the finite element model. A new coupling scheme between the finite element and the cellular automaton model is developed allowing finite element mesh adaptation. A geometrical error estimator has been integrated in the finite element model to control the mesh size and orientation in order to increase the accuracy of the finite element solution. New interpretations of the experimental observations are accessible thanks to the new 2D CAFE model. The 2D CAFE model is also successfully applied to a benchmark solidification test developed recently for a rectangular cavity experiment. Comparisons with maps of temperature, macrosegregation and grains structures have been performed demonstrating the model capabilities to deal with heat and mass exchanges at micro and macro scales.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional solidification model has been developed to study the directional solidification of dendritic alloys. It is based on the resolution of the heat flow equation using a two-interface front tracking technique. The two interfaces are defined by imaginary limits, assumed to be macroscopically flat, which correspond to the positions of the growing dendritic and eutectic interfaces. These delimit the three regions that are considered: liquid, mushy zone and solid. Growth kinetics laws are applied to the interfaces by velocity vs temperature relationships. It was found that, if complete solidification was carried out directionally up to the top of the ingot (i.e. formation of a fully columnar structure), then the velocity of the dendrite tips first increased during the stage of the superheat loss, then decreased when no substantial thermal gradient remained in the liquid ahead of the growing dendritic interface. Applied to directional solidification experiments carried out with aluminium{\textendash}silicon alloys, the model shows that this maximum velocity was reached when the top position of the mushy zone (i.e. the dendritic interface) reached about two-thirds the length of the ingots. This position being in the vicinity of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) observed in the longitudinal section of the ingots, a CET scenario is proposed based on a constrained-to-unconstrained growth transition, leading to breakdown of the columnar dendritic front.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a method for solving the equations governing time-dependent, variable density incompressible flow in two or three dimensions on an adaptive hierarchy of grids. The method is based on a projection formulation in which we first solve advection{\textendash}diffusion equations to predict intermediate velocities, and then project these velocities onto a space of approximately divergence-free vector fields. Our treatment of the first step uses a specialized second-order upwind method for differencing the nonlinear convection terms that provides a robust treatment of these terms suitable for inviscid and high Reynolds number flow. Density and other scalars are advected in such a way as to maintain conservation, if appropriate, and free-stream preservation. Our approach to adaptive refinement uses a nested hierarchy of logically-rectangular girds with simultaneous refinement of the girds in both space and time. The integration algorithm on the grid hierarchy is a recursive procedure in which coarse grids are advanced in time, fine grids are advanced multiple steps to reach the same time as the coarse grids and the data at different levels are then synchronized. The single grid algorithm is described briefly, but the emphasis here is on the time-stepping procedure for the adaptive hierarchy. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the algorithms's accuracy and convergence properties, and illustrate the behavior of the method. An additional example demonstrates the performance of the method on a more realistic problem, namely, a three-dimensional variable density shear layer.},

	url = {https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01146245/document},
	abstract = {Nowadays, with the increase in computational power, numerical modeling has become an intrinsic tool for predicting physical phenomena and developing engineering designs. The modeling of these phenomena poses scientific complexities the resolution of which requires considerable computational resources and long lasting calculations.In this thesis, we are interested in the resolution of complex long time and large scale heat transfer and fluid flow problems. When the physical phenomena exhibit sharp anisotropic features, a good level of accuracy requires a high mesh resolution, hence hindering the efficiency of the simulation. Therefore a compromise between accuracy and efficiency shall be adopted. The development of space and time adaptive adaptation techniques was motivated by the desire to devise realistic configurations and to limit the shortcomings of the traditional non-adaptive resolutions in terms of lack of solution's accuracy and computational efficiency. Indeed, the resolution of unsteady problems with multi-scale features on a prescribed uniform mesh with a limited number of degrees of freedom often fails to capture the fine scale physical features, have excessive computational cost and might produce incorrect results. These difficulties brought forth investigations towards generating meshes with local refinements where higher resolution was needed. Space and time adaptations can thus be regarded as essential ingredients in this recipe.The approach followed in this work consists in applying stabilized finite element methods and the development of space and time adaptive tools to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical simulations.The derivation process starts with an edge-based error estimation for locating the regions, in the computational domain, presenting sharp gradients, inner and boundary layers. This is followed by the construction of nodal metric tensors that prescribe, at each node in the spatial mesh, mesh sizes and the directions along which these sizes are to be imposed. In order to improve the efficiency of computations, this construction takes into account a fixed number of nodes and generates an optimal distribution and orientation of the mesh elements. The approach is extended to a space-time adaptation framework, whereby optimal meshes and time-step sizes for slabs of time are constructed in the view of controlling the global interpolation error over the computation domain.},

	abstract = {This work is dedicated to the modeling of macrosegregation and deformation during solidification of
castings. A two-dimensional finite element model to simulate macrosegregation due to thermal-solutal
convection in the case of columnar dendritic solidification is presented. A set of volume-averaged
conservation equations of energy, solute, momentum and mass is solved in conjunction with the use of the
lever rule as a microsegregation model. Several formulations have been implemented, permitting a
resolution with either weak or strong coupling, closed or open system. In order to improve the prediction
accuracy, an algorithm for dynamic remeshing is proposed. The basic idea is to generate fine elements near
the liquidus isotherm. The norm of the gradient of solid fraction is used for piloting the remeshing in the
mushy zone; while the objective mesh size in the liquid is considered as a function of the distance to the
liquidus isotherm.
The numerical approach has been validated with a benchmark test of macrosegregation in Pb-Sn
alloys taken from the literature. The influences of mesh size, time step and coupling scheme have been
investigated. Sufficient fine meshes, small time step and possibly coupling iterations should be applied in
order to predict segregated channels. Moreover, the efficiency of mesh adaptation is demonstrated by
predictions of freckles in a case of unidirectional solidification, and of {\textquoteleft}A-type{\textquoteright} segregation bands in a large
industrial carbon steel ingot.
In the last part of this work, regarding fluid flow in the liquid induced by solidification
shrinkage and thermo-convection and deformation in the solid, a thermal mechanical model has
been implemented with a Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation. The alloy in the liquid state is
Newtonian, and in the mushy state it is modeled by a viscoplastic continuum. Below a critical
temperature the alloy is considered by a thermal elastic viscoplastic model. The thermo-mechanical
simulation is used to predict the shrinkage pipe, air gap, strains and stresses.},

The solidification front is treated as a moving interface in the diffuse approximation as known from phase-field theories. The no-slip condition between the melt and the solid is realized via a drag resistivity in the diffuse interface region. The model is shown to accurately reproduce the usual sharp interface conditions in the limit of a thin diffuse interface region. A first test of the model is provided for flow through regular arrays of cylinders with a stationary interface. Then, two examples are presented that involve solid/liquid phase-change: (i) coarsening of a mush of a binary alloy, where both the interface curvature and the flow permeability evolve with time, and (ii) dendritic growth in the presence of melt convection with particular emphasis on the operating point of the tip.},

The continuum formulation was used to characterize the macroscopic mass, energy and momentum transports for two-phase systems. It was assumed that the interdendritic liquid flow was driven by thermal and solutal buoyancy, as well as by solidification contraction. The movement of free surface during solidification contraction and of precipitated solid phases in the early stage of solidification was taken into account. Validation of this model was performed for the case of inverse segregation in a directionally solidified Al-4.0\% Cu casting with equiaxed grains. Calculated results show that positive segregation is formed in the vicinity of the bottom chill, associated with negative segregation in the mushy zone.},

Overall macrosegregation patterns predicted using Scheil and lever-rule type microsegregation models are found to be similar, although the predicted eutectic fraction is significantly higher with the Scheil-type model. The choice of mushy zone permeability function significantly affects the predicted number, length and orientation of segregated channels. The inclusion of shrinkage-driven flow leads to the prediction of the well-known inverse macrosegregation pattern. However, macrosegregation caused by thermosolutal convection readily masks the inverse segregation. The microsegregation models predict different solid concentrations and eutectic fractions, leading to different solid density distributions which, in turn, cause differences in the extent of contraction-driven flow.},

Due to problems with the control system of the space furnace both seeds were molten and the growth began with polycrystals. As the growth proceeded, one grain was selected in each sample and the growth finished with a single crystal. X-ray analysis has shown that, in the zone where there was no contact with the crucible, the structural quality continuously improved. Chemical segregation obtained in space is representative of a diffusive regime of transport in the melt, in spite of the low growth rate used. This differs from ground experiments which are under convective conditions. Measurements of electrical properties have given results comparable to that of standard samples obtained on earth, but with a rather lower electrical resistivity.},

Accurate predictions of transport phenomena in solidifying dendritic alloys also depend on the form of the solute conservation equation. Therefore, this conservation equation is derived with particular consideration to an accounting of the diffusion of solute in the dendritic solid. Calculations for Pb-Sn alloy show that the distribution of the volume fraction of interdendritic liquid (g L) in the mushy zone is sensitive to the extent of the diffusion in the solid.

An Al alloy sheet ingot was cast with constant casting conditions (speed, superheat, cooling rate) except for the grain refiner: the first half of the ingot was non-inoculated, while the second half was inoculated. The results indicate that the extent and intensity of the centreline segregation is modified via the grain-refinement treatment: the finer the grains are, the more intense is the macro-segregation.Numerical simulations of directional solidification of binary Al{\textendash}Cu alloys have been carried out with the help of a 2D finite volume software which takes account of the movement of the liquid with respect to the solid in the mushy zone.

Another phenomena based on pressure differences between the hot and cold sides of the liquid can explain dewetting in the case of thermodynamic wetting angles, even in the case of metals and on the ground. The effect of various parameters such as contact angle, growing angle, crystal radius and pressure difference have been studied and a stability analysis has shown that the growth process is stable for high contact angles. For low contact angles, the growth is not stable, but the high pressure differences needed to get reasonable values of the gap thickness between the wall and the crucible can have a stabilizing effect.},

The model includes the heat transport in both the solid and liquid part, fluid flow in the liquid phase by the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations, tracking of the melt interface solid/liquid by the Stefan condition, treatment of the capillary boundary accounting for surface tension effects and a radiative boundary condition. We show that an accurate treatment of the moving boundaries is crucial to resolve their respective influences on the flow field and thus on the overall energy transport correctly. This is achieved by a mesh-moving method, which explicitly tracks the phase boundary and makes it possible to use a sharp interface model without singularities in the boundary conditions at the triple junction. A numerical example describing the welding of a thin-steel wire end by a laser, where all aforementioned effects have to be taken into account, proves the effectiveness of the approach.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A dense array of thermocouples permits monitoring of temperatures in the cavity and in the heat exchangers surrounding the cavity. After solidification, the grain structure is revealed by metallography. X-ray radiography and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry are also conducted to access a distribution map of Pb, or macrosegregation map. The solidification model consists of solutions for heat, solute mass, and momentum conservations using the finite element method. It is coupled with a description of the development of grain structure using the cellular automaton method. A careful and direct comparison with experimental results is possible thanks to boundary conditions deduced from the temperature measurements, as well as a careful choice of the values of the material properties for simulation. Results show that the temperature maps and the macrosegregation map can only be approached with a three-dimensional simulation that includes the description of the grain structure.},

The model consists of averaged energy and species conservation equations, coupled with nucleation and growth laws for dendritic structures. A new mechanism for the CET is proposed based on solutal interactions between the equiaxed grains and the advancing columnar front{\textemdash}as opposed to the commonly used mechanical blocking criterion. The resulting differences in the CET prediction are demonstrated for cases where a steady state can be assumed, and a revised isotherm velocity (V T ) vs temperature gradient (G) map for the CET is presented. The model is validated by predicting the CET in previously performed unsteady, unidirectional solidification experiments involving Al-Si alloys of three different compositions. Good agreement is obtained between measured and predicted cooling curves. A parametric study is performed to investigate the dependence of the CET position on the nucleation undercooling and the density of nuclei in the equiaxed zone. Nucleation undercoolings are determined that provide the best agreement between measured and calculated CET positions. It is found that for all three alloy compositions, the nucleation undercoolings are very close to the maximum columnar dendrite tip undercoolings, indicating that the origin of the equiaxed grains may not be heterogeneous nucleation, but rather a breakdown or fragmentation of the columnar dendrites.},

	abstract = {Abstract:  Different containerless processing techniques have different strengths and weaknesses. Applying more than one technique allows various parts of a problem to be solved separately. For two research projects, one on phase selection in steels and the other on nucleation and growth of quasicrystals, a combination of experiments using electrostatic levitation (ESL) and electromagnetic levitation (EML) is appropriate. In both experiments, convection is an important variable. The convective conditions achievable with each method are compared for two very different materials: a low-viscosity, high-temperature stainless steel, and a high-viscosity, low-temperature quasicrystal-forming alloy. It is clear that the techniques are complementary when convection is a parameter to be explored in the experiments. For a number of reasons, including the sample size, temperature, and reactivity, direct measurement of the convective velocity is not feasible. Therefore, we must rely on computation techniques to estimate convection in these experiments. These models are an essential part of almost any microgravity investigation. The methods employed and results obtained for the projects levitation observation of dendrite evolution in steel ternary alloy rapid solidification (LODESTARS) and quasicrystalline undercooled alloys for space investigation (QUASI) are explained.},

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

Metallurgical characterizations consist of composition measurements using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry and analyses of SEM images. The distribution maps drawn for the average copper composition, the volume fraction of the eutectic structure and the dendrite arm spacing reveal strong correlations. An equiaxed solidification model based on mass and heat balances is developed for the interpretation of the measurements. The model predicts the effect of diffusion in the liquid and in the solid, as well as the consequences of the recalescences occurring immediately after the nucleation of the primary dendritic structure and the eutectic structure. The nucleation undercooling of the eutectic structure is shown to be a key parameter for a quantitative prediction of the fraction of phases in the solidified samples.},

	abstract = {A new implementation of surface tension effects in interfacial flow codes is proposed which is both fully implicit in space, that is the interface never has to be reconstructed, and also semi-implicit in time, with semi-implicit referring to the time integration of the surface tension forces. The main idea is to combine two previously separate techniques to yield a new expression for the capillary forces. The first is the continuum surface force (CSF) method, which is used to regularize the discontinuous surface tension force term. The regularization can be elegantly implemented with the use of distance functions, which makes the level set method a suitable choice for the interface-tracking algorithm. The second is to use a finite element discretization together with the Laplace{\textendash}Beltrami operator, which enables simple reformulation of the surface tension term into its semi-implicit equivalent. The performance of the new method is benchmarked against standard explicit methods, where it is shown that the new method is significantly more robust for the chosen test problems when the time steps exceed the numerical capillary time step restriction. Some improvements are also found in the average number of nonlinear iterations and linear multigrid steps taken while solving the momentum equations.

Inverse segregation was found to exist, and the extent of segregation in the first 50 pct of the ingot solidified agreed well with that calculated from inverse segregation theory based on the flowback of enriched liquid. However, at higher points in the ingot, the solute distribution deviated from the theoretical one. Also, more and bigger shrinkage pores existed in the equiaxed grained ingot than in a columnar grained ingot. It is suggested that the formation of randomly distributed, equiaxed grains restricts the flowback of enriched interdendritic liquid much more than the formation of columnar grains where interdendritic channels exist. In an equiaxed grained ingot solidified vertically from the bottom upward, the hydrostatic pressure becomes insufficient to cause complete flowback of enriched liquid in the latter stages of solidification. This effect causes porosity in the ingot and a solute distribution which deviates from that predicted by the theory of inverse segregation.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of a numerical criterion to provide quantitative insight on freckling conditions is critical to the successful manufacture of large superalloy castings. Of the criteria reported in the literature, those based on the Rayleigh number seem best suited to predict the onset of freckle formation. However, in their current form, these criteria cannot explain why freckles develop predominantly at the surface of single crystal (SX) castings and at midradius in VAR/ESR ingots. An experimental Bridgman-type furnace has been built to directionally solidify freckle-prone superalloys, CMSX-11B, REN{\'E}88, NIM80A, WASPALOY, MAR-M247, and a variation of IN718 with high silicon content, at various angles to the vertical. Under typical industrial solidification conditions (thermal gradient between 500 and 4000 K m-1 (5{\textless}G{\textless}40 {\textdegree}C cm-1) and solidification rate between 1.67{\texttimes}10-5 and 1.0{\texttimes}10-4 m s-1 (1{\textless}R{\textless}6mm min-1)), the results indicate a dependency of freckling on growth front angle likely related to the anisotropy in permeability. A modified Rayleigh criterion has been developed which accounts for directional permeability and orientation of the growth front relative to the gravity vector. Application to the experimental data shows good correlation with the onset of freckling for the range of solidification conditions examined in the study. The approximate threshold value for the modified Rayleigh number was estimated to be for CMSX-11B, 0.88, for REN{\'E}88, 0.90, for NIM80A, 0.85, for WASPALOY, 0.95, for MAR-M247, 0.86, and for IN718-Si, 0.65.},

	abstract = {A numerical method for the simulation of buoyancy-induced macrosegregation during solidification processes is presented. The physical model is based on volume averaged conservation equations for energy, mass, momentum, and solute. The resulting partial differential equations are solved by a finite element method, which considers two different length-scales: on the one hand, the scale of the overall process, on the other, a small critical zone near the solidification front where solutal inhomogeneities are initiated and the fluid velocity is non-zero. A domain decomposition method using two adapted grids has been developed. The overall computational domain is discretized using a `coarse' finite element mesh adapted to the process scale. At each time step, the energy conservation equation is solved using this discretization and new values of temperature and solid fraction are calculated at each finite element node. Based on these values, the computational domain is subdivided into three subdomains: the so-called solid, mushy, and liquid regions. The mushy subdomain corresponds to the critical zone near the solidification front and is adaptively discretized with a finer finite element mesh, whereas the liquid domain uses the initial coarse grid and the solid is no longer considered. The fluid flow and solute transport equations are then solved on the different meshes using a Dirichlet{\textendash}Neumann substructuring iterative method, together with the mortar technique to deal with the non-conforming discretizations at the subdomain interfaces. The method is applied to several test problems such as the Hebditch{\textendash}Hunt macrosegregation experiment or the prediction of freckles, and the performances and limits of the approach are pointed out and discussed.},

Defects such as A-segregates are still commonplace, and components are regularly scrapped due to their presence, leading to increased economic and environmental costs. With the growth of the nuclear power industry, and the increased demands placed on new pressure vessels, it is now more important than ever that today{\textquoteright}s steel ingots are as chemically homogeneous as possible.This article briefly reviews the development of our current understanding of macrosegregation phenomena during the 20th century, before going on to assess the latest developments in the field of macrosegregation modelling. The aim of the text is to highlight the shortcomings of applying contemporary macromodels to steel-ingot casting, and to suggest practical alternatives. In addition, the experimental characterisation of macrosegregation is explored, and a review of the various techniques currently available is presented.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a three-dimensional Navier{\textendash}Stokes solver for incompressible two-phase flow problems with surface tension and apply the proposed scheme to the simulation of bubble and droplet deformation. One of the main concerns of this study is the impact of surface tension and its discretization on the overall convergence behavior and conservation properties. Our approach employs a standard finite difference/finite volume discretization on uniform Cartesian staggered grids and uses Chorin's projection approach. The free surface between the two fluid phases is tracked with a level set (LS) technique. Here, the interface conditions are implicitly incorporated into the momentum equations by the continuum surface force method. Surface tension is evaluated using a smoothed delta function and a third-order interpolation. The problem of mass conservation for the two phases is treated by a reinitialization of the LS function employing a regularized signum function and a global fixed point iteration. All convective terms are discretized by a WENO scheme of fifth order. Altogether, our approach exhibits a second-order convergence away from the free surface. The discretization of surface tension requires a smoothing scheme near the free surface, which leads to a first-order convergence in the smoothing region. We discuss the details of the proposed numerical scheme and present the results of several numerical experiments concerning mass conservation, convergence of curvature, and the application of our solver to the simulation of two rising bubble problems, one with small and one with large jumps in material parameters, and the simulation of a droplet deformation due to a shear flow in three space dimensions. Furthermore, we compare our three-dimensional results with those of quasi-two-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations. This comparison clearly shows the need for full three-dimensional simulations of droplet and bubble deformation to capture the correct physical behavior.

	abstract = {Transient and steady-state distributions of temperature and stress along the centerline of a single, initially molten metal droplet deposited onto a comparatively large substrate are examined. After investigating droplet deposition onto a room temperature substrate, the effect of substrate preheating on residual thermal stresses is quantified. Also, deposition of a second droplet is modeled and the effect on residual stresses of localized preheating by the first deposited droplet is assessed. Temperature-dependent conductivity, specific heat and density are used in coupled thermal models of droplet and substrate domains. Mechanical models include temperature-dependent Young's modulus, linear expansion coefficient and creep. Two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric thermal and mechanical results are compared to one-dimensional (1D) results which approximate conditions along the droplet/substrate centerline. It is found that the more computationally efficient 1D models aid in interpreting the 2D results and provide reliable estimates of maximum stress magnitudes. Methods and results from this investigation are relevant to processes in which molten superheated metal contacts solid metal, such as welding processes. The specific application of interest in this work is droplet-level thermal and mechanical modeling of the microcasting stage of shape deposition manufacturing, which is a layered manufacturing process for the automated manufacture of complex three-dimensional metal parts.},

The coupled problem of liquid and air flow, heat transfer with the solid wall together with the liquid vaporization process from the droplet{\textquoteright}s free surface is predicted using a VOF-based methodology accounting for phase-change. The cooling of the solid wall surface, initially at 120 {\textdegree}C, is predicted by solving simultaneously with the fluid flow and evaporation processes, the heat conduction equation within the solid wall. The range of impact velocities examined was between 1.3 and 3.0 m/s while focus is given to the process during the transitional period of the initial stages of impact prior to liquid deposition. The droplet{\textquoteright}s evaporation rate is predicted using a model based on Fick{\textquoteright}s law and considers variable physical properties which are a function of the local temperature and composition. Additionally, a kinetic theory model was used to evaluate the importance of thermal non-equilibrium conditions at the liquid{\textendash}gas interface and which have been found to be negligible for the test cases investigated. The numerical results are compared against experimental data, showing satisfactory agreement. Model predictions for the droplet shape, temperature, flow distribution and vaporised liquid distribution reveal the detailed flow mechanisms that cannot be easily obtained from the experimental observations.},

The solute enriched interdendritic flow remelts both primary and secondary arms, and can deflect the primaries. This enables solutal channels to become self-sustaining, forming freckles.

It is shown that de-wetting leads to enhanced quality of the crystal produced and that capillary-induced convection effects are not to be feared in this case.

The algorithm is based on a nonlinear temperature evaluation using the average enthalpy which is provided by (i) tabulated phase transformation paths and (ii) tabulated phase properties. The compatibility of this method with tabulations using a thermodynamic database, allows simulating solidification at equilibrium with multiple phase transformations for binary and multicomponent alloys. The method has been validated and applied to three-dimensional cases with macrosegregation: a binary Sn{\textendash}3 wt.\% Pb alloy and a ternary Fe{\textendash}2 wt.\% C{\textendash}30 wt.\% Cr alloy. For the latter case, predictions include composition maps for C and Cr due to thermosolutal instability leading to freckle formation and the subsequent distributions of liquid, BCC, FCC, M7C3 and Cementite phases. Compared with a previously published enthalpy method, the temperature-based energy solver shows similar accuracy and faster computational time.},

	abstract = {Mathematical expressions of segregation rates occurring during solidification with spongy deformation of an alloyed mushy zone are derived from classical mass balance analyses. The boundaries of the domain considered for the mass balances deform with the same velocity as the solid phase: the reference frame is attached to the solid phase. The three variables needed to fully describe segregation within this {\textquotedblleft}Lagrangian{\textquotedblright} approach are the mass of solid in the domain, the volume of the domain and the relative velocity of the liquid with respect to the solid. The main result is a mathematical expression for the local macrosegregation rate. The analysis is further extended to produce an expression for the local microsegregation rate that can be compared with the one proposed by Flemings and Nereo (Trans. AIME 239 (1967) 1449{\textendash}1461). An additional term thus enters into our expression. This term is proportional to the local strain rate multiplied by the ratio of the volume fraction of solid over the volume fraction of liquid. It is expected to become dominant when the mushy zone is fully developed (large value of the ratio) and when the strain can be transmitted through a coherent solid skeleton that deforms like a sponge. Still, the origin of the deformation remains arbitrary and the derived expressions could be used to quantify segregation due to the thermal contraction of the solid and liquid phases, the shrinkage associated with the phase transformations, and/or the mechanical deformation of the domain. Finally, the expression for the local microsegregation rate is combined with the first law of thermodynamics. The rate of progress of solidification is thus related to the rate of heat extraction, the transport of heat due to the relative liquid flow with respect to the solid, and the enthalpy of dissolution of the solid in the liquid.},

	abstract = {A fast numerical model has been developed for the quantitative prediction of microsegregation during solidification of ternary alloys. Considering a small volume of uniform temperature, the back-diffusion equations in the primary solid phase are solved in a 1-dimensional configuration using an implicit finite difference formulation with a Landau transformation onto a fixed [0,1] interval. The other phases which may precipitate during solidification are supposed to be stoichiometric and at equilibrium while the liquid is in a state of complete mixing. These calculations are coupled with phase diagram data through the use of mapping files: the liquidus surface, the monovariant lines and all the pertaining information are mapped through calls to Thermo-Calc [B. Sundman, B. Jansson and J. O. Andersson, CALPHAD, 9, 153 (1985)], prior to starting the microsegregation calculation itself. This very efficient microsegregation model can thus be coupled directly to macrosegregation computations performed at the scale of a whole casting: from the average enthalpy and concentrations variations computed at each mesh point of a casting during one time step, this microsegregation model is capable of predicting the variations of temperature, of the volume fractions of the various phases, of the liquid concentrations and of the average density. The efficiency of this coupling between microsegregation calculation and thermodynamic mapping files is demonstrated in the particular case of the Al{\textendash}Mg{\textendash}Si system.},

For that purpose, a second FE mesh, referred to as CA mesh, is used. Fields can be interpolated between the adaptive FE mesh and the CA mesh. A CA grid made of a regular lattice of cubic cells is defined and superimposed onto the CA mesh. A new dynamic strategy for the allocation/deallocation of the CA grid is proposed to reduce the computation and memory costs. This CAFE model is applied to partial melting of an initial grain structure and epitaxial growth in the undercooled zone of a liquid pool, thus simulating the formation of solidification structure during the GTAW process.

The motion of the interface is tracked by the solution of a scalar transport equation for a phase-indicator field that is discontinuous at the interface and uniform elsewhere; no explicit interface reconstruction, which is perceived to be difficult to implement on unstructured meshes, is needed. The novelty of the method lies in the adaptive combination of high resolution discretisation schemes which ensure the preservation of the sharpness and shape of the interface while retaining boundedness of the field. The special implicit implementation presented herein makes it applicable to unstructured meshes and an extension to such grids is presented. The method is capable of handling interface rupture and coalescence. The paper outlines the methodology of CICSAM and its validation against academic test cases used to verify its accuracy.},

This paper provides an analysis of the flow in the neighbourhood of the cusp, via an idealized problem which is solved completely: the cylinders are represented by a vortex dipole and the solution is obtained by complex variable techniques. Surface tension effects are included, but gravity is neglected. The solution is analytic for finite capillary number \&Cscr;, but the radius of curvature on the line of symmetry on the free surface is proportional to exp (-32$\pi$\&Cscr;) and is extremely small for \&Cscr; \&gsim; 0.25, implying (in a real fluid) the formation of a cusp. The equation of the free surface is cubic in (x, y) with coefficients depending on \&Cscr;, and with a cusp singularity when \&Cscr; = $\infty$.The influence of gravity is considered through a stability analysis of the free surface subjected to converging uniform strain, and a necessary condition for the development of a finite-amplitude disturbance of the free surface is obtained.An experiment was carried out using the counter-rotating cylinders as described above, over a range of capillary numbers from zero to 60; the resulting photographs of a cross-section of the free surface are shown in figure 13. For $\Omega$ $\Omega$c, the downward-pointing cusp forms, and its structure shows good agreement with the foregoing theory.},

The simulation is based on a previously developed model for multicomponent steel solidification with melt convection and involves the solution of fully coupled conservation equations for the transport phenomena in the liquid, mush, and solid. Heat transfer in the mold and insulation materials, as well as the formation of a shrinkage cavity at the top, is taken into account. The numerical results show the evolution of the temperature, melt velocity, and species concentration fields during solidification. The predicted variation of the macrosegregation of carbon and sulfur along the vertical centerline is compared with measurements from an industrial steel ingot that was sectioned and analyzed. Although generally good agreement is obtained, the neglect of sedimentation of free equiaxed grains prevents the prediction of the zone of negative macrosegregation observed in the lower part of the ingot. It is also shown that the inclusion of the shrinkage cavity at the top and the variation of the final solidification temperature due to macrosegregation is important in obtaining good agreement between the predictions and measurements.},

	abstract = {The origin of freckles during unidirectional solidification is studied in a transparent, low melting model system, 30 wt pct NH4C1-H2O. In 30NH4Cl-H2O, freckles are caused by upward flowing liquid jets in the mushy zone. The jets erode the mushy zone causing localized segregation and start new grains by producing dendritic debris. It is shown that the jets observed in 30NH4C1-H2O are free convection resulting from a density inversion in the mushy zone. A comparison of driving force, thermal transport effects and solute transport effects in 30NH4C1-H2O and metallic systems shows that jets are possible in metallic alloys where light elements segregate normally or heavy elements segregate inversely. It is concluded that freckles in unidirectionally solidified castings and vacuum consumable-electrode ingots are caused by convective jets. It is shown that the tendency to freckle is greatest in alloys with a large density inversion, high thermal diffusivity, low solute diffusivity, and low viscosity. For a given alloy, the driving force for freckling is proportional to the inverse square of the thermal gradient. Erosion by the jets is decreased by increasing the thermal gradient and growth rate. The location of freckles is influenced by mushy zone curvature.},

An open dendritic network is exposed to solute-rich liquid which arrives from the solidification front. At grain boundaries such openness is even more pronounced, leaving higher-order branches highly exposed to the incoming solute-rich liquid stream. It was found that streaming of solute-enriched liquid at the tip of high-order branches promotes growth by local undercooling. Further solute advection and local solute rejection due to the local growth causes solute pile-up at the roots of the branches. This solute pile-up alters the local compositional balance at the solid{\textendash}liquid interface at the root, causing the root to remelt, which in turn results in further branch detachment.},

While the FE method solves the macroscopic conservation equations for heat and mass transfers, the CA method is used at a mesoscopic scale to simulate the growth of a mushy zone domain. The limit between this mushy zone domain and the undercooled liquid melt in which it develops defines the envelope of a single grain. A verification is first performed to check that the CAFE model retrieves the solution of a purely FE simulation for a vanishing undercooling of the growth front. Since the present 2D CAFE model is relevant with respect to the solidification experiment developed by Yin and Koster [H. Yin, J. N. Koster, J. Crystal Growth 205 (1999) 590; H. Yin, J. N. Koster, J. Alloy Compd. 352 (2003) 197], comparison is then performed. In particular, the position of the growth front is considered as a time sequence. The effect of the growth undercooling is clearly revealed. The kinetics of the growth front used in the model assumes the development of a rough interfacial dendrite-like morphology. This assumption is discussed considering the value of the normalized entropy of fusion of gallium.},

As a result, it was not possible to correctly predict the macrosegregation in the center of the product. It is generally suspected that the motion of the equiaxed grains is responsible for this macrosegregation. A multiphase and multiscale model that describes the evolution of the morphology of the equiaxed crystals and their motion is presented. The model was used to simulate the solidification of a 3.3-ton steel ingot. Computations that take into account the motion of dendritic and globular grains and computations with a fixed solid phase were performed, and the solidification and macrosegregation formation due to the grain motion and flow of interdendritic liquid were analyzed. The predicted macrosegregation patterns are compared to the experimental results. Most important, it is demonstrated that it is essential to consider the grain morphology, in order to properly model the influence of grain motion on macrosegregation. Further, due to increased computing power, the presented computations could be performed using finer computational grids than was possible in previous studies; this made possible the prediction of mesosegregations, notably A segregates.},

	title = {Peritectic solidification of {Cu}-{Sn} alloys: microstructure competition at low speed},
	abstract = {Many commercially important alloys such as Fe-C, Fe-Ni, Cu-Zn, Cu-Sn and Ti-Al exhibit peritectic transitions on solidification. In the two-solid phase region of peritectic metallic systems, a wide spectrum of microstructures has been revealed during directional solidification experiments at low growth rates, where both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-phases would grow independently as planar fronts [1, 2, 12{\textendash}20]: discrete bands, islands, simultaneous growth of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-phases in the form of oriented lamellae or fibers and continuous oscillatory tree-like microstructures in highly convective peritectic systems [3, 21, 22]. Recently, Vandyoussefi et al. [27] and Dobler et al. [16] have done extensive solidification experiments on Fe-Ni alloys in the corresponding two-solid phase region. Depending on the growth conditions and local composition, a lamellar eutectic-like structure was observed. Despite recent works, the peritectic solidification at low growth rate is not fully understood. Additionally, coupled growth was observed only for peritectic systems for which the solidification interval of the primary phase $\Delta$? 0$\alpha$ is fairly small and with negligible convection; but is it also possible for peritectic alloys with fairly large $\Delta$? 0$\alpha$ such as Cu-Sn? If so, what would be the effect of convection? And finally, is the coupled growth front really isothermal? In the present contribution, the peritectic Cu-Sn system has been chosen because of its remarkable properties and technological importance. Indeed, two essential features distinguish Cu-Sn alloys from other peritectic systems: The equilibrium solidification interval of the a-phase decreases with the tin concentration in the hypoperitectic composition range. Additionally, the equilibrium solidification interval of the primary phase is about 25 times larger in the Cu-Sn system than in the Fe-Ni peritectic system. Since only few studies have been made on the detailed solidification of tin bronze alloys, the first goal of this study was to carry out thermal analyses in order to investigate precisely the solidification of Cu-Sn alloys and to measure temperatures of solid-state phase transformations. Therefore, an SPTA assembly has been built and successfully calibrated. Additionally, a heat flow model was developed in this work and coupled with a Cu-Sn thermodynamic database to treat solidification-dependent latent heat. Single pan thermal analyses on three Cu-Sn alloy compositions revealed that the corresponding phase diagram recently re-investigated in Liu et al. review [28] is the most reliable. Directional solidification experiments on Cu-Sn alloys of various compositions have been conducted at different velocities in a high gradient Bridgman furnace. In this context, the set-up already used by Dobler [14] has been modified in order to reduce the size of the samples and, accordingly, natural convection and the associated macrosegregation. During each solidification run, two different geometries were thus tested (3 mm diameter cylinder and 4/6 mm tube), allowing the observation of convection effects on solidifying microstructures. An essential outcome of this project is that $\alpha$+$\beta$ lamellar structures have been observed in both sample geometries, even when Vp is above the critical velocity for the $\alpha$ planar front growth, i.e., the $\alpha$-phase grew with a cellular morphology. With the Cu-Sn phase diagram used in the present work and for positions close to the quenched interface, concentration profiles measured across the lamellar structures revealed that the corresponding operating temperature ?*(x) seems to be non-isothermal, in contradiction with previous experimental observations in Fe-Ni peritectic alloys [14{\textendash}16]. But, since the Cu-Sn phase diagram is not assessed accurately, ?*(x) is still subject to large variations ({\textpm}10{\textdegree}C). On the other hand, the peritectic transformation after solidification has been evidenced and modifies the compositions and fractions of phases. Additionally, local concentration showed that a partial banding mechanism and an unstable lateral propagation of both solid phases were responsible for the formation of lamellar structures. Various geometrical arrangements were revealed on transverse cuts of lamellar structures: straight $\alpha$- and $\beta$-lamellae, labyrinth-like microstructures, disordered arrays of rods of one phase in the matrix of the other phase and uniform regions of $\beta$-phase. The dynamic evolution of lamellar structures was attributed to growth competition mechanisms and instabilities between phases originated from the same nuclei. Finally, it should be noted that the Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship was observed between the primary and the peritectic phases on both the straight lamellae and labyrinth-like microstructure. Finally, all lamellar structures ended by the termination of $\alpha$-lamellae and the subsequent growth of a $\beta$ planar front. In this context, the $\alpha$-lamellae of lamellar structures observed in the 4/6 mm tube exhibited in all cases a "hammer-like" morphology before being overgrown by the peritectic phase. Careful investigations of this morphology revealed that it resulted effectively from growth competition mechanisms, which remain to be fully understood. In a simulated geometry corresponding to the 4/6 mm tube of Cu-Sn samples, 3D macrosegregation modeling revealed that a nearly helical convection pattern existed in the liquid phase ahead of a moving planar $\alpha$-liquid interface. And between each plume, the fluid flow was mostly oriented parallel to the solid-liquid interface. As a consequence, the lateral propagation of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-phases during the 3D growth competition was surely affected by these convective motions. Finally, natural convection and the associated solute enrichment were assumed to be responsible for the destabilization of lamellar structures and the subsequent end of $\alpha$-lamellae. The multi-phase field computations emphasized that the stability of the triple junction between $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and liquid phases is function of the initial alloy concentration C0, of the lamellar spacing $\lambda$ and of the thermal gradient Gl. In a near future, directional solidification experiments are planned to be conducted onboard of the International Space Station. Then, the obtained peritectic microstructures will have to be compared with the microstructures observed in the present work in order to assess more precisely the effect of natural convection on the formation of lamellar structures.},

	abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

Using a phase-field variable and a corresponding governing equation to describe the state (solid or liquid) in a material as a function of position and time, the diffusion equations for heat and solute can be solved without tracking the liquid-solid interface. The interfacial regions between liquid and solid involve smooth but highly localized variations of the phase-field variable.

	abstract = {A new 3D finite element model, developed in a level set approach, is proposed to model hybrid gas metal arc/laser welding in multipass conditions. This heat and mass transfer model couples the resolution of the heat conservation equation, the momentum and mass conservation equations and the weld bead development. The arc welding total power is divided in two parts: one corresponding to the energy transferred to the fusion zone by droplets of melted filler material, the rest being transferred to the workpiece by the surrounding plasma. The droplets energy input is modelled as a volumetric heat source. Regarding the heat surface fluxes associated with plasma and laser heating, the {\textquotedblleft}Continuum Surface Force{\textquotedblright} approach is used to model them as volumetric heat sources concentrated in the immediate neighbourhood of the metal{\textendash}gas interface. A resolution scheme, consisting in ignoring high velocity fluid flow in the fusion zone, through the use of an augmented liquid viscosity, is proposed and discussed. Accordingly, the liquid thermal conductivity is enhanced to result in a realistic heat transfer to the workpiece. The formation of the weld bead is obtained through the introduction of a source term in the mass conservation equation, and the application of the normal component of surface tension forces, proportional to the mean curvature of the metal{\textendash}gas interface. This approach is proposed to reduce computation time. The resolution scheme is applied to the simulation of hybrid welding of 18MND5 (ASME SA 533) steel grade. Results are compared to experimental measurements and observations operated in conditions close to industrial ones. The influence of the enhancement applied to the liquid conductivity coefficient is shown and discussed. A strong sensitivity evolution is demonstrated when varying it from the physical value to the value proposed in the welding literature. As proposed, the simplified resolution scheme leads to a good estimation of the weld bead surface development. Nevertheless, there are still noticeable differences with the whole set of experimental results that are discussed and can be explained by model limitations and insufficient knowledge of material and interfacial properties.},

	abstract = {A Rayleigh number based criterion is developed for predicting the formation of freckles in Ni-base superalloy castings. This criterion relies on finding the maximum local Rayleigh number in the mush, where the ratio of the driving buoyancy force to the retarding frictional force is the largest. A critical Rayleigh number for freckle formation of approximately 0.25 is found from available experimental data on directional solidification of a Ni-base superalloy. If the Rayleigh number in a superalloy casting is below this critical value, freckles are not expected to form. Full numerical simulations of freckling in directional solidification of superalloys are conducted for a large variety of casting conditions, alloy compositions, and inclinations of the system with respect to gravity. For the vertical cases, the Rayleigh numbers at the starting points of the predicted freckles are in good agreement with the critical value established from the experiments. The simulations confirm that the same critical Rayleigh number applies to different superalloys. The simulations for inclined domains show that even a small amount of inclination (less than 10 deg) significantly lowers the critical Rayleigh number and moves the freckles to the side wall of the casting, where the mushy zone has advanced the most relative to gravity. In application of the Rayleigh number criterion to complex-shaped superalloy castings, the absence of freckles near upper and lower boundaries and in sections of insufficient cross-sectional area or height needs to be taken into account as well. The criterion can be used to study the tradeoffs between different superalloy compositions, applied temperature gradients, and casting speeds. Additional experiments, in particular for other superalloys and for a range of inclinations, are desirable to confirm the critical Rayleigh numbers found in the present study.},

The three permeability laws have similar permeability in the inner part of the mushy zone (low liquid fraction regions), however, in the outer part of the mushy zone (high liquid fraction regions) permeability differs significantly. Simulations are performed for the solidification of a Sn{\textendash}Pb alloy in a two-dimensional rectangular cavity using the three permeability laws and the effects of differences in these laws in the outer part of the mushy zone on macro- and meso-segregation are studied. We notice a sensitivity of the predicted macro- and meso-segregation, and of the width and shape of the mushy zone to various permeability laws. The sensitivity of the prediction of mesosegregates is much stronger than that of macrosegregation predictions. The value of the microstructural parameter used in the permeability laws plays an important role on the intensity of the macrosegregation and the nature of channel segregates with regard to their number, length and orientation. It has been observed that the permeability in the outer part of the mushy zone plays a key role in the formation of channel segregates.},

It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension.

This mapping technique is modified in arranging the mapping axes where the tabulation is performed to increase the access efficiency. This strategy provides a practical solution for quick access to phase diagram data in modeling macrosegregation of multicomponent alloys. It is found from our simulation that the contribution of each of the solute elements to the solutal buoyancy affects the final segregation pattern. The appropriate choice of the solidification path is important for the shrinkage-induced macrosegregation.

The unstable density stratification at the solidification front causes the formation of rising plumes containing solute-rich liquids. The development of the chimneys and the probability of their surviving depend sensitively on the spatial and temporal properties of the flow field. Variations of the vertical temperature gradient along the solidification cell lead to the observation of different mechanisms for chimney formation. Perturbations of the dendritic structure are the origin of development of segregation freckles in case of low temperature gradients. The long-term stabilities of these segregation channels are strongly influenced by the transient nature of the melt convection. The situation at higher temperature gradients is characterized by two dominating convection rolls in the liquid phase which are driven by a lateral temperature gradient and the convex shape of the solidification front. The penetration of this flow pattern into the mushy zone results in continuous accumulation of solute in the central part of the mushy zone followed by a remelting of the solid fraction and the occurrence of a stable chimney.},

The combination of the two models permits application to steels, dealing with partial-equilibrium for solidification and para-equilibrium for both the $\delta$-BCC to $\gamma$-FCC peritectic transformation and the $\gamma$-FCC to $\alpha$-BCC solid state transformation.

It is shown that the freckle lines are linear assemblies of small random equiaxed grains which are enriched in all but the inversely segregated solute species. Excessive interdendritic porosity and feeding shrinkage are observed in the vicinity of a freckle line. Some correlations of the tendency toward freckling and the geometric distribution of freckle lines are made with growth rate, thermal gradient, and interface shape. The dependence of freckling tendency on composition is examined in the Ni-Al system.},

A layer of virtual boundary elements is introduced in order to couple the surface and the volume remeshing. A mesh size map can be introduced directly in the shape factor of elements. The mesh optimization of the modified shape factor provides implicitly the adapted mesh. Finally the adaptation cycle is presented, which consists in computing a mesh size map on the current mesh, to adapt the mesh, to compute again the mesh sie map and to adapt again until a convergence state is reached.

Macrostructural examination revealed predominantly columnar structure associated with high degree of segregation and porosities in all billets cast above 21{\textdegree}C of tundish superheat. Centerline porosity was practically absent in the billet cast below 21{\textdegree}C. These billets showed prominent V-segregation and less prominent centerline segregation.

Many types of macrosegregation result from thermosolutal convection in the solid plus liquid and all-liquid regions of a solidifying alloy, and this has spurred modeling and simulations, which treat the solid plus liquid region (i.e., the mushy zone) as a porous medium of variable porosity and permeability. Simulations include scenarios in which the convection is strong enough to make channels in the mushy zone region, and these channels lead to localized segregates known as {\textquotedblleft}freckles{\textquotedblright}. Using Pb-10 wt.\% Sn as a model alloy, we simulated vertical solidification with various solidification rates. By sufficiently increasing the cooling rate at the bottom surface, convection can be suppressed enough to prevent the formation of freckles. The simulation is an example of relating microstructural metrics to a macroscopic property of the porous medium used in continuum theory. In this case, the property is the permeability, which is governed by two microstructural metrics: the volume fraction of liquid and a characteristic length in the dendritic microstructure. Permeability data, relevant to columnar dendritic solidification, are reviewed, and recommendations for future work on determining the permeability in terms of microstructural metrics are given.},

	abstract = {Solidification is one of the oldest processes known for producing complex shapes for applications ranging from art to industry, and today it still remains one of the most important commercial technologies for many materials. Since the 1980s, numerous fundamental developments in the understanding of solidification processes and microstructure formation have been derived from both analytical theories and the application of computational techniques using commonly available powerful computers. This book integrates these developments in a comprehensive volume that also presents and places them in the context of more classical theories. Divided into three sections, the text evolves from fundamentals to applications, giving professional engineers and students a firm understanding that they can readily apply.  The first part, Fundamentals and Macroscale Phenomena, presents the thermodynamics of solutions and then builds on that subject to motivate and describe equilibrium phase diagrams. Transport phenomena are discussed next, focusing on the issues of most importance to liquid-solid phase transformations, then moving on to describe in detail both analytical and numerical approaches to solving such problems.  The second part, Microstructure, employs these fundamental concepts for the treatment of nucleation, dendritic growth, microsegregation, eutectic and peritectic solidication, and microstructure competition. This part concludes with a chapter describing the coupling of macro- and microscopic phenomena in microstructure development.  Defects, the third and final section describes various types of defects that may occur {\textemdash} with emphasis on porosity, hot tearing, and macrosegregation {\textemdash} presented using the modeling tools and microstructure descriptions developed earlier in the text.

	abstract = {A multi-phase model is presented that predicts melt pressure, feeding flow, and porosity
formation and growth in steel castings during solidification. By combining Darcy{\textquoteright}s law, which
governs fluid flow in the mushy zone, with the equation for Stokes{\textquoteright} flow, which governs the
motion of slow-flowing pure liquid, it is possible to derive a momentum equation that is valid
everywhere in the solution domain. A pressure equation is then derived by combining this
momentum equation with a continuity equation that accounts for the solid, liquid and gas phases
present. The partial pressures of the gas species dissolved in the melt are determined using the
species concentrations, which are found by solving a species conservation equation for each gas
species present. This species equation accounts for macrosegregation of gas species due to the
flow. Once the total gas pressure is high enough to cause pore nucleation, the amount of
porosity that forms is determined from the continuity equation. This multi-phase model has been
successfully implemented in a general-purpose casting simulation code. Results are presented to
illustrate the basic physical phenomena involved. For two of the examples provided, the
predicted porosity distributions are compared to radiographs of steel castings produced in sand
molds. Good agreement is found between simulation and casting results. An appendix is
included that describes preliminary work on another defect modeling project involving
reoxidation inclusions.},

Thermocouples, placed in the chill and the mold, were used to calculate heat flux, thermal gradient, and solidification rate. The ingots were examined with respect to macro- and microstructures, distribution of phases, dendrite arm spacing, and solute element distribution. The extent of macrosegregation of carbon and sulfur was determined by wet chemical analysis of drillings, and a TANDEM VAN DE GRAAFF accelerator was used for A1, Si, P, V, S, C, Mn, Ni, and Cu. The extent of macrosegregation of these elements was correlated with heat transfer and thermodynamic distribution coefficient data.},

An explicit time stepping scheme is used for solving coupled temperature and concentration fields, while an implicit scheme is used for solving equations of motion. The explicit approach results in a local point-by-point coupling scheme for the temperature and concentration fields that uses constitutive model for back diffusion in solid. The present method offers distinct advantages of simplicity and flexibility in incorporation of micro-scale models, as demonstrated by the use of a back diffusion parameter in the microsegregation model. Results from the present method are compared with those in the literature using a fully implicit method, and they show significant improvement in final macrosegregation prediction.},

Measured temperatures also indicate that dendrite fragments are transported throughout the mold cavity during early stages of solidification, and convection patterns similar to those predicted by numerical simulation can be inferred from the measurements. While there is general agreement between measured and predicted trends for macrosegregation, the numerical simulation, which assumes axial symmetry, cannot predict the inherently three-dimensional nature of solute redistribution.

	abstract = {{\textquoteleft}Fluid buckling{\textquoteright} is a phenomenon characterized mainly by the existence of fluid toroidal oscillations during flow. It appears when a high viscosity fluid flows vertically against a flat surface and may occur in industrial applications, as in injection molding of a propergol in complex-shaped cavities. These coiling or folding oscillations appear during the mold filling stage, leading to air entrapment. To understand and to model this free surface flow problem, a convected level set method is proposed. First, a sinus filter is applied to the distance function to get a smooth truncation far from the interface. Second, the reinitialization is embedded in the transport equation model, avoiding it as a separate step during calculation. In order to validate the method, numerical results are presented on classical interface capturing benchmarks. Finally, results are shown on two-dimensional and three-dimensional viscous jet buckling problems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In particular, it will be shown that boundary layers, flow detachments and all vortices are well captured automatically by the mesh. We present an anisotropic meshing based on a posteriori estimation for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations. The proposed a posteriori estimate is based on the length distribution tensor approach and the associated edge based error analysis. The Finite Element flow solver is based on a Variational MultiScale (VMS) method, which consists in here of decomposing both the velocity and the pressure fields into coarse/resolved and fine/unresolved scales. This choice of decomposition is shown to be efficient for simulating flows at high Reynolds number. The stabilization parameters are determined taking into account the anisotropy of the mesh using a directional element diameter. The adaptation algorithm is applied to high Reynolds number flows inside the 2D and 3D lid-driven cavities and compared to accurate reference solutions.},

	abstract = {A new crystal growth process, based on the Bridgman method, but with the aim to avoid crystal crucible contact, has been studied and implemented. The principle is to impose a gas pressure at the cold part of the crucible, approximately equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the molten sample, in order to get a small liquid meniscus between the solid{\textendash}liquid interface and the crucible. A first-order capillary stability analysis shows that stable conditions can be reached for the growth of semiconductors by this technique. The relevant technical parameters were computed for the growth of antimonide semiconductors and contactless samples of these materials have been obtained in silica crucibles. They show surface roughness close to what is generally observed when dewetted growth occurs in space.},

This paper outlines the origin of this effect and presents a modification to the model in which the predicted behavior is quantitatively correct in the important limits. Application of the modified analysis is shown to be simple and to lead to realistic descriptions of the solidification behavior in mushy freezing alloys. As an example, the model is applied to two steels solidifying over a range of cooling rates and the results indicate that such systems will in many cases be quite close to thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to carbon redistribution.},

Several algorithm modifications and strategies to maximize parallel efficiency are introduced. Improvements on a real case simulation are measured and discussed. The CA?FE implementation here is demonstrated using 32 computing units to predict grain structure in a 2.08?m???0.382?m???0.382?m ingot involving 4.9 billion cells and 1.6 million grains. These numerical improvements permit tracking of local changes in texture and grain size over real-cast parts while integrating interactions with macrosegregation, heat flow and fluid flow. Full 3D is essential in all these analyses, and can be dealt with successfully using the implementation presented here.},

The experiment consists in solidifying a rectangular ingot of Sn{\textendash}3 wt.\%Pb alloy using two lateral heat exchangers to extract the heat flux from one or two sides of the sample. The temperature difference between the two sides of the heat exchangers may vary from 0 to 40 K and the cooling rate from 0.02 to 0.04 K/s. This slow-cooling condition has been used to promote segregation formation. An array of fifty thermocouples placed on the corresponding sample walls is used to determine the instantaneous temperature distribution. During the solidification process, the temperature field is recorded versus time and analyzed. This makes it possible to estimate the change in temperature due to natural convection, the velocity field and the solidification macrostructure and segregation behavior. After each experiment, the segregation patterns are obtained by X-ray analysis and confirmed by eutectic fraction measurements. The local solute distribution is determined by means of induction coupled plasma analysis.},

The methods are based on solving a single set of transport equations for the whole computational domain and treating the different phases as a single fluid with variable material properties. Changes in these properties are accounted for by advecting a phase indicator function. Interfacial exchange terms are incorporated by adding the appropriate sources as delta functions or smoothed gradients of the composition field at or across the interface. The strategies are first discussed within the isothermal phase context and then for situations featuring inter-phase heat and mass transfer.

Measurements have been made of plume-channel compositions and those of their surroundings, by direct sampling of transparent liquids and by electron microprobe analysis of fully solidified metallic alloys, after the events. Plume liquid temperatures were also measured in the transparent materials and flow rates were measured from video records of particle movements. The plume-channel widths and spacings are remarkably similar in all these materials despite their physical differences. Analysis shows that the flow rates for the transparent systems fit a Poiseuille relation, modified for slip at the plume boundaries. Extrapolation of this analysis, using measured channel compositions and estimated buoyancy terms, predicts plume flow velocities in metals to lie between 1.10-1 and 2.10-1 m. s-1. The factors that determine the pattern selection of the plume-channel dimensions, compositions and flow rates are discussed with reference to thermal equilibrium, the onset of turbulence and the restrictions to the liquid re-entrainment needed to sustain such flow.},

	abstract = {In this paper, mass and momentum conservation equations are derived for the flow of interdendritic liquid during solidification using the volume-averaging approach. In this approach, the mushy zone is conceived to be two interpenetrating phases; each phase is described with the usual field quantities, which are continuous in that phase but discontinuous over the entire space. On the microscopic scale, the usual conservation equations along with the appropriate interfacial boundary conditions describe the state of the system. However, the solution to these equations in the microscopic scale is not practical because of the complex interfacial geometry in the mushy zone. Instead, the scale at which the system is described is altered by averaging the microscopic equations over some representative elementary volume within the mushy zone, resulting in macroscopic equations that can be used to solve practical problems. For a fraction of liquid equal to unity, the equations reduce to the usual conservation equations for a single-phase liquid. It is also found that the resistance offered by the solid to the flow of interdendritic liquid in the mushy zone is best described by two coefficients, namely, the inverse of permeability and a second-order resistance coefficient. For the flow in columnar dendritic structures, the second-order coefficient along with the permeability should be evaluated experimentally. For the flow in equiaxial dendritic structures(i.e., isotropic media), the inverse of permeability alone is sufficient to quantify the resistance offered by the solid.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the application of the two-phase solidification model with a splitting scheme for coupling macroscopic transport and grain growth, described in part I of this work, is presented with simulations of solidification of a binary alloy in a rectangular cavity. The splitting method is first verified by comparing the predictions with a classical directly coupled method. The verification is performed for a critical limiting case, as identified in part I, with infinitely fast microscopic diffusion (lever rule) and a fixed solid in the mushy zone. A further test is performed to show the capability of our model, where macroscopic transport and diffusion-controlled grain growth kinetics are coupled by the splitting scheme, in predicting recalescence. Thereafter, the complete model, as presented in part I, is applied to simulate solidification in its full complexity, considering the grain motion and grain growth kinetics. With the help of the model predictions the influence of the motion of globular solid grains on the transport phenomena during solidification and formation of macrosegregation is discussed.},

	abstract = {A solute diffusion model, aimed at predicting microstructure formation in metal castings, is proposed for dendritic solidification of alloys. The model accounts for the different length scales existing in a dendritic structure. This is accomplished by utilizing a multiphase approach, in which not only the various physical phases but also phases associated with different length scales are considered separately. The macroscopic conservation equations are derived for each phase using the volume averaging technique, with constitutive relations developed for the interfacial transfer terms. It is shown that the multiphase model can rigorously incorporate the growth of dendrite tips and coarsening of dendrite arms. In addition, the distinction of different length scales enables the inclusion of realistic descriptions of the dendrite topology and relations to key metallurgical parameters. Another novel aspect of the model is that a single set of conservation equations for solute diffusion is developed for both equiaxed and columnar dendritic solidification. Finally, illustrative calculations for equiaxed, columnar, and mixed columnar-equiaxed solidification are carried out to provide quantitative comparisons with previous studies, and a variety of fundamental phenomena such as recalescence, dendrite tip undercooling, and columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) are predicted.},
