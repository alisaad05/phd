Metallurgical processes have known a great evolution during the last 60 years. The advancement is attributed to 
research disciplines, like physical metallurgy, which investigated a great deal of solidification-related phenomena.
Today, research in metallurgy focuses on a deeper understanding of the connection between the different physical scales.
Solidification is not only a phase change, but also a complex transformation involving small scales like nucleation, medium scales
like grains growth and large scales like convection in the melt. 
From the nucleation theory to the mechanical behavior of metals, intricate phenomena combine to form defects in the final product. This has been seen in casting processes, such as continuous casting and ingot
casting. Surface and volume porosity, hot tearing and composition heterogeneity are known defects to the casting community.
As far as the current project is concerned, the last defect, also widely known as macrosegregation, is the subject of this thesis.

\section*{Defects}
\comment{Worth checking notes from the Ecole Thématique CNRS oléron (Check Mail Draft)}
Undesired effects are inevitable in any industrial process. More importantly, a lot of defects in the casting industry can be disastrous in some situations where the cast product is not serviceable and hence rejected. This leads to a systematic product recycling, i.e. the product is ditched to be reheated, remelted and then cast again. From an economic point view, the operation is expensive timewise and profitwise. Understanding and preventing defects when possible, is thus crucial in the casting industry.
We focus hereafter on the main encountered defects.

\subsection*{Hot tearing}
This defect, also denoted solidification cracking or hot cracking, occurs in the mushy zone at high solid fractions when a failure
or crack appears at specific locations, the hot spots. The temperature range in which the steel is vulnerable to hot tearing is known as the brittleness temperature range (BTR). It corresponds to solid fractions greater than \num{90}\%, with the liquid phase forming a discontinuous film (\red{FIGURE A}). Many factors can cause the failure, but the main origin is a lack of liquid feeding required to compensate for the solidification shrinkage, in the presence of thermal stresses in the mushy region. Therefore, a crack initiates then propagates in the casting (\red{FIGURE B}). 

\subsection*{Porosity}

\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting_defect} \\
Porosity is a void defect formed inside the casting or at the outer surface. It may attributed to two different factors.
Firstly, we speak of \emph{shrinkage porosity}, when a void forms as a result of density differences between the interdendritic liquid and solid
network, the latter being denser than the former. It is basically, the same reason that initiates hot cracks. 
The second factor is the presence of dissolved gaseous phases in the melt. According to \cite{dantzig_solidification_2009}, these gases may be initially in the melt, or created by the reaction between the metal and water found in the air or at trapped in grooves at the molds surface. If the decreasing temperature and pressure drop in the liquid are large enough, the latter becomes supersaturated. Consequently, the nucleation of gaseous phase is triggered (just like when you open a cold bottle of coca-cola!).

\subsection*{Freckles and segregated channels} 
The intersection between the effects of microsegregation and gravity forces is the origin of freckles. They may appear 
randomly (spacewise) in casting processes, but are very specific to directional chill casting (\cite{giamei_nature_1970}), mainly vertical chill casting. 
\comment{give a more detailed example in chapter 3: e.g. Pb Sn is not like Sn Pb and explain}
Segregation takes place at a medium scale (ranging from the scale of a few dendrites to a few hundreds of them), hence forms "long and narrow trails" \cite{felicelli_simulation_1991}. It was also seen that small equiaxed grains are frequently in segregated channels. It may be explained by a uniform temperature
gradient that settles as the channels become richer in solute. 
on the ingot's surface, as well as in the volume (\blue{thèse kohler exemple or article felicelli}).

\subsection*{Macrosegregation}
In principle, macrosegreation stems from the same causes of freckles and segregated channels. However, this defect is characterized by a composition heterogeneity on much larger scale (\red{give scale}).

Beckermann review 2000 or the big review article by rappaz, rohit, beckermann ...}

\section*{Industrial Worries}
\textbf{Production}

\begin{itemize}
\item Talk about total steel production, variations over the last few decades
\item Quality constraints for many applications that require steel like construction, nuclear engines ? 
\item Difficulties to meet these constraints and what are the present solutions
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Research and Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Need for software handling multicomponent alloys
\item Need for software handling finite diffusion in the solid
\item Need for realistic alloy properties (not only constants)
\item Need for handling molds along with volume change (creating thermal resistances)
\end{itemize}

\section*{CCEMLCC contribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item some words about this ESA project
Since its foundation in 1975, the European Space Agency (ESA) has been actively committed in the research field.
Their areas of activity cover not only exclusive space applications, but also fundamental science related to 
physics mainly, as well as other disciplines. This thesis is part of the ESA project entitled CCEMLCC, abbreviating
"Chill Cooling for the Electro-Magnetic Levitator in relation with Continuous Casting of steel". 
The three-year contract from 2011 to 2014 denoted CCEMLCC II, was preceded by an initial project phase, CCEMLCC I,
from 2007 to 2011.
\comment{make sure of dates from CCEMLCC report}

\item in what ways does this project tries to alleviate the aforementionned problems ?
The two phases of CCEMLCC, together with the newly coming CCEMLCC III, aim to shape our understanding
of solidification with thermo-mechanical stresses under microgravity conditions.

\item academic and industrial partners and how does each of them contribute actually
\item mention \emph{Thercast} as the final developped code destination ?
\item \cimlib our in-house code
\end{itemize}
