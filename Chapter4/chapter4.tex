\section{Introduction}
% ======================

Solidification shrinkage is, by definition, the effect of relative density change between the liquid and solid phases.
In general, it results in a progressive volume change during solidification, until the phase change has finished. 
The four stages in \cref{fig:real_ingot_stage_a,fig:real_ingot_stage_c,fig:real_ingot_stage_b,fig:real_ingot_stage_d} depict the volume change with 
respect to solidification time.
First, at the level of the first solid crust, near the local solidus temperature, the solid forms with a density smaller than 
the liquid's. This does not necessarily apply for all materials, but at least for steels it does. The subsequent volume difference 
tends to create voids with a big negative pressure, that needs to be compensated by a surrounding fluid. It thus drains 
the liquid metal in its direction (cf. \autoref{fig:real_ingot_stage_b}). As a direct result of the inward feeding flow, the ingot surface
tends to gradually deform in the feeding direction, forming the so-called \emph{shrinkage pipe}. Since the mass of the alloy and its 
chemical species is conserved, a density difference between the phases ($\rhol < \rhos \implies \frac{\rhol}{\rhos}<1$) eventually leads 
to a different overall volume ($V^s<V^l$) once solidification is complete, as confirm the following equations:
%------------
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
& \rhol V^l = \rhos V^s  \\ 
& V^s = \frac{\rhol}{\rhos} V^l
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%------------
Solidification shrinkage is not the only factor responsible for volume decrease. Thermal shrinkage in both solid and liquid phases, as well 
as solutal shrinkage in the liquid phase are also common causes in a casting process. Henceforth, we will focus on shrinkage due to phase change.

\section{FE model: Metal}
%--------------------------------------------------
%
In this section, we start from a the monodomain finite element model presented in \cref{sec:monodomain} relevant to metal only, 
then present the essential assumptions and formulations that allow predicting solidification shrinkage in a Eulerian context.

\subsection{Mass and momentum conservation}
% ======================
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
% ======================
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item Two phases are considered, liquid $l$ and solid $s: \gl+\gs =1 $ % \implies \frac{dg^l}{dt} =- \frac{dg^s}{dt}$ 
\item The phase densities are constant but not equal: $ \rhol=cst_1 $ and $ \rhos=cst_2 $. Thermal and solutal expansion/contraction
is neglected
\item The solid phase is assumed static: $\vec{v^s}=\vec{0}$, which yields the following consequences:
\begin{enumerate} % \cancelto{0}{blablabla}
\itemsep0em
\item $ \avg{\vec{v}}= \gl \vec{v^l} + \cancel{\gs \vec{v}^s} = \gl \vec{v}^l $
\item $ \avg{\rho \vec{v}} = \gl \rhol \vec{v}^l + \cancel{\gs \rhol \vec{v}^s} = \gl \rhol \vec{v}^l $
\item $\nabvec \rhol = \nabvec \rhos = \vec{0}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
% ======================
\subsubsection{Formulation}
% ======================
The mass balance equation averaged over the two phases, is expanded taking into account the aforementioned assumptions.
%
%--------------------------
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:shrinkage}
\begin{align}
& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \avg{\rho \vec{v}}  = 0 \\ 
& \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \brac{ \gl \rhol + \gs \rhos} + \nabla \cdot \brac{ \gl \rhol \vec{v}^l} = 0 \\ 
& \gl \cancel{\frac{\partial \rhol }{\partial t}} + \rhol \frac{\partial  \gl }{\partial t} 
	+ \gs \cancel{\frac{\partial \rhos }{\partial t}} + \rhos \frac{\partial  \gs }{\partial t} 
	+ \rhol \nabla \cdot \brac{ \gl \vec{v}^l} 
	+ \gl \vec{v}^l \cdot  \cancel{ \nabvec \rhol }	 = 0 \\
& \brac{ \rhol - \rhos } \frac{\partial  \gl }{\partial t} + \rhol \nabla \cdot \brac{ \gl \vec{v}^l}  = 0
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:mass_balance_metal}
 \boxed{\nabla \cdot \brac{ \gl \vl} 
 	= \nabla \cdot \vit
 	= \frac{\rho^l-\rho^s}{\rho^l} \frac{\partial  \gs }{\partial t}}
\end{align}
%--------------------
%
With the assumptions of static solid phase and constant unequal phase densities, the average mass balance states that 
the divergence of the liquid velocity is proportional to the solidification rate, by a factor of density change, 
which results in a relative volume change. \Cref{eq:mass_balance_metal} explains the flow due to shrinkage. In metallic alloys, the solid density is
usually greater than the liquid density, therefore the first term in the RHS is negative. As for the second term, if we
neglect remelting, then it'll be positive in the solidifying areas of the alloy. A negative divergence term in these areas, 
means that a liquid feeding is necessary to compensate for the density difference, hence acting as a flow driving force in the melt.
In the case of constant densities, we can easily deduce that the divergence term is null, and therefore no flow is induced
by solidification. Furthermore, additional terms should appear in the other conservation equations, balancing the volume 
change in the heat and species transport.
%
%-----------------------------------
%\subsection{Momentum Conservation}
%-----------------------------
%
When the metal's density was considered constant during solidification, the assumption of an incompressible system made it possible to
use the Boussinesq approximation. However, in the case of solidification shrinkage, the average density $\r = \gs \rhos + \gl \rhol $
varies, since $\rhos$ and $\rhol$ are not equal. Naturally, these phase densities would depend on temperature and possibly on the phase composition. 
Therefore, the incrompressibility condition may not be true. In such case, the earlier given system \cref{eq:Navier-Stokes2} is reformulated without 
any reference value for density:
%------
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:momentum_balance_metal}
   \left\{
   \begin{aligned}
      & \rhol \brac{\tempup{ \vit } + \frac{1}{\gl} \nabvec \cdot \brac{\vit \times \vit}} = \\
	  &- \gl\nabvec \pl - 2 \mul \nabvec \cdot \brac{\nabmat \vit + \nabmattransp \vit}
	  - \gl \mul \K^{-1} \vit + \gl \rhol \gravity\\ \\
      & \nabla \cdot \vit =  \frac{\rho^l-\rho^s}{\rho^l} \tempup{\gs}
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation}
%------------
%====================================================================
\subsection{Energy conservation}
% ======================
We have seen the averaged energy conservation equation in the case of two phases: 
a solid phase and an incompressible liquid phase. However, with the incorporation of
the shrinkage effect, new terms should appear in the advective-diffusive heat transfer equation. 
% ======================
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
% ======================
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item The thermal conductivity is constant for both phases: $\avg{\kappa} = \ks = \kl= \kappa $ 
%\item consideration of a fixed solid ($ \vec{v}^s=\vec{0} $).
\item Consequence of the static solid phase: $\avg{\rho h \vec{v}} = \gl \rhol \hl \vl +  \cancel{\gs \rhos \hs \vs} = \gl \rhol \hl \vl$ 
\item The system's enthalpy may thermodynamically evolve with pressure, knowing that $h=e+\frac{p}{\rho}$, where $e$ is the internal energy and $p$ is the pressure. It infers that the heat transport
equation may contain a contribution attributed to volume compression/expansion:
\begin{align}
			 \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \brac{p \vec{v}}
			 = \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}+ p \nabla \cdot \vec{v} + \vec{v} \cdot \nabvec p 
\end{align}
In the literature, this contribution has been always neglected, even when accounting for solidification
shrinkage, owing to the small variations of pressure.
\item The heat generated by mechanical deformation, $\mathbb{S}:\dot{\varepsilon}$, is neglected
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item $\avg{\rho h}= \gl \rhol \hl + \gs \rhos \hs $
%\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
% ======================
\subsubsection{Formulation}
% ======================
The unknowns in the energy conservation are the average volumetric enthalpy $\avg{\rho h}$ and temperature $T$.The energy conservation equation writes:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho h}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \avg{\rho h \vec{v}} 
	= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\avg{\kappa} \nabvec T } \\
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho h}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \brac{\gl \rhol \hl \vl}
	= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\kappa \nabvec T } \\ 
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho h}}{\partial t} 
		+ \rhol \hl  \nabla \cdot \vit
		+ \vit \cdot \nabvec \brac{\rhol \hl}
		= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\kappa \nabvec T } \\   
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho h}}{\partial t} 
		+ \cancel{\rhol} \hl  \frac{\rhol-\rhos}{\cancel{\rhol}} \frac{\partial  \gs }{\partial t}
		+ \vit \cdot \nabvec \brac{\rhol \hl}
		= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\kappa \nabvec T } \\ 
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho h}}{\partial t} 
		+ \brac{\rhol-\rhos} \hl \frac{\partial  \gs }{\partial t}
		+ \vit \cdot \nabvec \brac{\rhol \hl}
		= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\kappa \nabvec T }        
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:energy_balance}
 \boxed{ \frac{\partial \avg{\rho h}}{\partial t} 
		+ \rhol \vit \cdot \nabvec \hl
		= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\kappa \nabvec T }
		+ \brac{\rhos-\rhol} \hl \frac{\partial  \gs}{\partial t}}
\end{align}
%----------------
%
In order to keep things simple, the term "enthalpy" will refer henceforth to "volume enthalpy",
otherwise, we will explicitly use the term "mass enthalpy". It is important to understand the 
meaning of the terms in equation \eqref{eq:energy_balance}.
The first term in the left-hand side is the temporal change in the system's average enthalpy,
i.e. a temporal change in the volume enthalpy of any of the phases in the course of solidification.
The second LHS term is a dot product between the superficial liquid velocity and the the gradient
of the liquid's enthalpy. Since phase densities are constant in our case, the gradient term reduces
to the liquid's mass enthalpy. If we consider a representative volume element (RVE) in the liquid
phase, far from the mushy zone, we can stipulate:
%
%--------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:gradient_liquid_enthalpy}
& \nabvec \hl = C_p^l \nabvec T
\end{align}
%--------------
%
assuming that the phase mass specific heat, $ C_p^l $, is constant. Therefore, the liquid enthalpy
is advected in the case where the velocity vector is not orthogonal to the temperatre gradient.
The advection reaches its maximum when the two vectors have the same direction. Consider, for instance,
a filled ingot with a cooling flux applied to its bottom surface. If the density variation with temperature
were to be neglected, then the sole mechanical driving force in the melt is the density jump at the solid-liquid
interface ahead of the mushy zone. The temperature gradient in such a case is vertical upward, while the velocity
vector is in the opposite direction. The advective term writes:
%
%--------------
\begin{align}
\label{eq:enthalpy_advection}
& \rhol \vit \cdot \nabvec \hl = - \rhol C_p^l \norm{\vit} \norm{\nabvec T}
\end{align}
%--------------
%

\caption{Effect of one-dimensional shrinkage flow on a solidifying ingot}
\end{figure}
%----------------------
%
We see that the second LHS term in equation \eqref{eq:energy_balance} acts as 
a heat source at the interface between the the phases, in this particular solidification
scenario. Another heat power (of unit $Wm^{-3}$) adds to the system in the mushy zone, 
that is the second term in the RHS of the same equation. This term is 
proportional to the solidification rate. Finally, the first RHS term accounts for thermal 
diffusion within the phases.
\newline
It should be emphasized that the assumption of a constant specific heat in the liquid in 
equation \eqref{eq:gradient_liquid_enthalpy} applies when no macrosegregation occurs. 
Nonetheless, when the latter is considered, the phases specific and latent heats become 
highly dependent on the local average composition. It then advisable to use the thermodynamic 
tabulation approach, where the enthalpies are directly tabulated as functions of temperature 
and intrinsic phase compositions. 
% ======================
\subsection{Species conservation}
% ======================
The last conservation principle is applied to the chemical species or solutes. This principle allows predicting
macrosegregation when applied to a solidification system, along with the mass, momentum and energy balances.
However, the conservation equation should be reformulated in the case of a melt flow driven by shrinkage.
% ======================
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
% ======================
\begin{itemize}
\item The alloy is binary, i.e. it is composed from one solute, and hence the notation of the average composition
		without a solute index: $\wavg$ for the mass composition and $\avg{\rho w}$ for the volume composition
\item The solid fration is determined assuming complete mixing in both phases, hence the lever rule is applicable. It
		should be mentionned that the solidification path in the current approach is tabulated using thermodynamic data at 
		equilibrium
\item The macroscopic solutal diffusion coefficient $D^s$ in the solid phase is neglected in the mass diffusive flux term. The
		remaining term, $D^l$, is a mass diffusion coefficient in the liquid phase, of unit $m^2 s^{-1}$
\item Consequence of the static solid phase: $\avg{\rho w \vec{v}} = \gl \rhol \wl \vl +  \cancel{\gs \rhos \ws \vs} = \gl \rhol \wl \vl$ 
\end{itemize}
% ======================
\subsubsection{Formulation}
% ======================
The species conservation is pretty similar the energy conservation formulated in the previous section. For a binary alloy, we can write:
%
%--------------------------
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho w}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \avg{\rho w \vec{v}} 
	= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\rhol \avg{D^l} \nabvec \wl } \\
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho w}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \brac{\gl \rhol \wl \vl}
	= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\gl\rhol D^l \nabla \wl } \\ 
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho w}}{\partial t} 
		+ \rhol \wl  \nabla \cdot \vit
		+ \vit \cdot \nabvec \brac{\rhol \wl}
		= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\gl \rhol D^l \nabvec \wl } \\   
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho w}}{\partial t} 
		+ \cancel{\rhol} \wl  \frac{\rhol-\rhos}{\cancel{\rhol}} \frac{\partial  \gs }{\partial t}
		+ \vit \cdot \nabvec \brac{\rhol \wl}
		= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\gl \rhol D^l \nabvec \wl } \\ 
	& \frac{\partial \avg{\rho w}}{\partial t} 
		+ \brac{\rhol-\rhos} \wl \frac{\partial  \gs }{\partial t}
		+ \vit \cdot \nabvec \brac{\rhol \wl}
		= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\gl \rhol D^l \nabvec \wl }        
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:solute_balance_metal}
 \boxed{ \frac{\partial \avg{\rho w}}{\partial t} 
		+ \rhol \vit \cdot \nabvec \wl
		= \nabla  \cdot \brac{\rhol D^l \nabvec \wl }
		+ \brac{\rhos-\rhol} \wl \frac{\partial  \gs}{\partial t}}
\end{align}
%--------------
%
The species transport equation is usually derived with the volumetric average composition $\avg{\rho w}$, then
divided by the density, which is constant if no solidification shrinkage occurs. In the case where macrosegregation
is solely due to fluid flow generated by natural or forced convection, the overall
volume remains constant. It is thus convenient to compute composition variations using the mass variable $\wavg$.
However, in the current context, the volume is subject to changes, hence the formulation of equation 
\cref{eq:solute_balance_metal} with $\avg{\rho w}$.

\section{FE model: Air}
Conservation equations for the air are close to those derived for the metal as a fluid, with the exception
of some points:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item air is a fluid that will not undergo any phase change, hence constant heat diffusivity;
\item species conservation is irrelevant in the air as it is considered a pure material;
\item unlike metal, air is considered incompressible at any time.
\end{itemize}

%------------
\subsection{Mass and momentum conservation}

%-----------
\subsection{Energy conservation}

%------------
\subsection{Species conservation}
%
The composition of alloying elements is crucial quantity to predict in this work. Nevertheless, such prediction is only relevant
in the metallic alloy, even if the air is also made up of other chemical species (nitrogen, oxygen ...). For this obvious reason,
the species conservation equation should not be solved in the air, but that of course is contradictory to the monolithic resolution.
The consequence is that we should compute the conservation of chemical species in the air and the metal, but limit as much as possible
the influence of the former, in a way to prevent a "numerical" solute exchange between these domains. To do so, the computed air velocity
will not be used here for advection, but rather use a zero-velocity vector instead. 
As diffusion is also another transport mechanism that may alter the conservation principle, a very low macroscopic solute diffusion 
coefficient can be used, as long as its order of magnitude is at most a thousand times less than that in the melt, $\Da \lll \Dl$.
The low artificial diffusion in the air may slightly violate the wanted no-exchange condition at the air-liquid interface, but it is 
known that suppressing the diffusion term in the air would result in a stiff partial differential equation that may be difficult to solve.
%--------------
\begin{align}
& \temp{\rhoa \wa} + \cancel{\nabla \cdot \brac{\rhoa \wa \vita} } - \diff{\rhoa \Da}{\wa} = 0 \\
\label{eq:solute_balance_air}
& \boxed{\temp{\rhoa \wa} - \diff{\rhoa \Da}{\wa} = 0}
\end{align}
%
%--------------
%
\section{FE monolithic model}
%---------------------------------------
The monolithic model combines all conservations equations in metal and air in a unique set of equations to be solved on a fixed mesh. 
This can be accomplished by using the Heaviside function (defined in \cref{sec:heaviside}) relative to each domain.

%------------------
\subsection{Interface treatment}
%
The level set method, like any other interface tracking/capturing method, needs defining a convenient way of coupling
the velocity field on the one hand, which is the solution provided by solving momentum conservation equations, with the 
interface position on the other hand. The question is "how does the velocity field transport the interface?". The answer
is potentially one of two possibilities: classical coupling or modified coupling. In the next subsections, we discuss
the technical details of each approach and the hurdles that come with it.
%---------
\subsubsection{Classical coupling}
%
A "classical" coupling comes in the sense of "unmodified" coupling. This approach consists of taking the output of the fluid mechanics
solver, then feed it as raw input to level set transport solver. The physical translation would be that the interface motion is dictated
by the fluids flow in its vicinity. No treatment whatsoever is done between the two mentioned steps. While conservation principles are best
satisfied with this approach, the latter yields some drawbacks, preventing its application in a generic way.
For instance, the free liquid surface is not necessarily horizontal at all times and that can lead to the wrong shrinkage profile
when solidification is complete.

\end{figure}
%----------------------
%%---------
\subsubsection{Modified coupling}
In contrast to a classic coupling, here we attempt to modify the velocity field before feeding to the transport solver.
The main motivation for considering this approach is the lack of stability that we observed whenever the mechanical
properties of the fluids were different by several orders of magnitude.
The algorithm should simultaneously fulfil these requirements: 
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item support high ratios of fluids density with close viscosities by preserving an non-oscillating interface,
\item maintain a horizontal level at the free surface of the melt,
\item follow shrinking metal surface profile in solidfying regions,
\item satisfy the mass conservation principle, essentially in the metal.
\end{itemize}
We want to process the original transport velocity by imposing a uniform motion (speed and direction) 
at the nodes of the free surface, and at the same time, be able to follow the pipe formation at the 
surface as a result of solidification shrinkage, as shown in \cref{fig:horizontal_liquid_surface}.

%-----------------------------------
The general idea is read the velocity around the interface up to a certain thickness, which may be the same 
thickness as the diffuse interface defined in \cref{sec:heaviside}, then compute a volumetric average
from all the elements in the thickness. This average is then given to the transport solver, which will apply
the same magnitude and direction to transport the interface. However, as we only need the transport velocity
to be uniform within the "100\% liquid" elements, it should not be the case for the other elements that belong 
either to the mushy zone or the solid region, where shrinkage is taking place.
Therefore, depending on the heat extraction configuration, two scenarios are possible. If heat extraction is far from
the interface, i.e. there is not direct contact as in \cref{fig:bottom_side_cooling}a, the surface area remains unchanged at any time, hence all the elements
around the interface are "100\% liquid". This happens when a bottom cooling is applied to the ingot. In contrast, if a side cooling 
is applied as shown in \cref{fig:bottom_side_cooling}b, the surface area of the interface will be reduced over time
as a consequence of the solid front progression. In this case, the average transport velocity should be computed only
from the elements belonging to the free surface. The remaining part of the interface which belongs to partial or full 
solid regions, is transported with Navier-Stokes output, which should be some orders of magnitude less than the velocity
imposed at the free surface, as a result of a decreasing permeability.
